From her leopard luggage to her animal-print shoes, Baskin - who possesses the most mysteriously mellifluous voice - appears to only take a break from her adored feline prints when she dons her second-best accessory of a flower crown, which she pairs with a bohemian kaftan-style top.
 
Perhaps when you take a moment to consider the provenance of these prints, and the fact that the characters of Tiger King have dedicated their worlds to breeding, rearing, protecting and working with and for these cats, their stylistic choices ostensibly make more sense.
 
The only character in the series who takes a break from the feline head-to-toe, style-of-dress is Exotic himself, who exhibits more of a porny cowboy aesthetic. He wears his series of sequinned shirts buttoned to the sternum, his eyes kohl-rimmed and his trousers seemingly sprayed-on, and leather.

An etching of a woman and satyr-child with a goat. Inscribed on a tablet at left: Tiepolo.

Giovanni Battista Tiepolo was one of the most celebrated painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He began making prints in the 1730s, and his first set of ten etchings, known as the Vari Capricci, are a personal response to the prints and drawings of Salvator Rosa and Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione that he had been able to study in the collections of Anton Maria Zanetti the Elder and Zaccaria Sagredo. The prints have no straightforward or overt meanings, though they generally show groups of figures at rest or in contemplation: soldiers and young boys in pastoral landscapes, a horse and rider with a groom, women and children with goats and other animals. Several prints evoke the ancient or Arcadian world, with figures set alongside tombstones, classical urns and fragments of obelisks; in one print the figure of Death is shown reading from an open book, faced by a group of the living.

How does the artistic imagination, or "fantasia," work? This question has intrigued great minds at least since antiquity, beginning with philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. This quest for understanding "fantasia" continued into the early modern era where it commingled with nascent scientific inquiry.
 
Most of us are somewhat familiar with the mixture of proto-scientific investigations and artistic fantasies in the oeuvres of Italian Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci. However, we are far less able to visualize parallel imagery from northern Europe. In her book on Jacques (or Jacob) de Gheyn II, Claudia Swan helps close this trans-Alpine gap, and to usher de Gheyn scholarship into the new millennium.
 
Swan's stated purpose in the book is to elide the perceived boundaries between early modern theories of science and those of imaginative image-making with the art of Jacob de Gheyn as her case study. Her book is divided into two parts: the first emphasizes the new scientific world in which de Gheyn lived, and the second uses his images of witches to chart the early modern tension between artists' perceptions of nature and imagination. In her introduction, Swan states that early modern thinkers believed that the same parts of the brain that allowed artistic license also coincided with the melancholic temperament. And, in part 2, particularly chapter 4, Swan points to contemporary science-minded skeptics, who attributed belief in and visions of witches to this same troubled, melancholic state of mind, particularly among older women.
 
As the artist Jacques de Gheyn routinely created rigorous (even virtuosic) botanical and scientific drawings alongside his otherworldly images of phantasms and w
