I wanted to do this, -iosgods-mod-menu-debs-for-non-jailbroken-ios-devices/#comment-5421799 but using the Chapters .deb hack ( -chapters-interactive-stories-v182-1-cheats/#comment-4380198 ) and the IPA file from the website store ( -chapters-interactive-stories-hack ). It seemed to be working and I followed the steps but when I opened my iphone (general > device management > developer app > trust [email protected]) it didn't work. It showed a message that said: "Chapters - iOSGods.com" requires Developer Mode to run. Until Developer Mode has been enabled this app will not be available for use. So what do I do now?

Thank you, it worked! The only issue is now it's saying "This version is out of date. Please go to your app store to download the newest version. Thank you for your support and understanding!". When I click on the link labeled 'go to store', it takes me to my apple app store but the original app is already downloaded so when I click 'open', the hack disappears. The little red iOSGods icon is gone, it's only appearing on the hacked/IPA Chapters from iOSGods not the one from app store....I'm not sure what's wrong now.
 
It first shows, this hack is made by awesome members over at IOSgods.com. next I can see that it logs into game center at the back but afterwards show free user access with my ID. When i enter the game, it is not my game center account but a fresh new account.
 
Deleted the cracked version which I downloaded through app+, downloaded the original from Apple Store, connected with fekir connect (right button beside the Game Center connecting button), then it uploaded the save game. After that I deleted the original version and downloaded another time the cracked version from iosgods app+. I entered the game and in the tutorial I hit settings and connected with the fekir connect to download the save game. It worked.

When you are in game and hit to settings button your screen is showing you wright in the middle of the screen the news button, than in the middle the Game Center connect button and on the right side the fekir (not kefir ?) connect button
 
Im having this same issue. The hack works great but Im unable to get my gamecenter account to the modded version. IF anyone has a fix or knows a fix please let us know! Id love to play on my main account.
 
Hey,  
  
I've been trying to get my Sideloadly to detect my Iphone for roughly an hour and a half, I've followed everything as instructed and even tried to login into the itunes app to see if that works.  
I have my pc trusted on my iphone and i get the popup along with the passcode prompt. However, I can't select anything on the dropdown menu in sideloadly.  
  
I have logged into the itunes web with my laptop and my phone to see if that changes anything, nothing.  
I have also reinstalled sideloadly twice, nothing.  
  
I'm at a loss at the moment, I'm unsure of what to do next and how to fix this damned issue.  
  
Any suggestions?,  
Thank you ever so much.
