**Flash Stock Firmware:**If your MTK device stuck at the Boot logo or not turning on then you easily flash the stock firmware to fix your device. In this case, you need to install the MTK USB Driver to get detected your device to the Computer.
 
**Repair IMEI:**Sometimes MTK USB VCOM and CDC driver unable to detect devices while writing IMEI using SN and MAUI meta IMEI writer tool. In this situation, Mediatek Drivers helps to get detected your device to the Computer.
 
**Official Supports:**Well, Universal MTK drivers help all MTK devices to be detected by most of MTK device repair applications on Windows PC, including all SP Flash Tool, SN Writer Tool, SP MDT Flash Tool.
 
MTK USB Driver is fully compatible with all versions of Windows OS, including Windows XP, 7, 8 and also Windows 10 (32 or x64 bit architecture). In case if you are looking for the latest version of the MTK Driver, then use the following below links to download it on your computer:

Here we share with you three different methods to install MTK USB Drivers on any Windows 32 and 64bit PC. The first method is an automatic method by simply using the setup wizard. This is the safest way to Install Mediatek Drivers on your PC.
 
Here on the below, I share a method to update MTK USB Drivers. If any of these above-listed methods are not working then you follow the below procedure to install the USB driver properly. for this method, you need to connect your PC with a good internet connection.
 
Profit ... haha. For now I'm happy with the result in porting / patching a driver from an older kernel / different project to Lede. Now trying to apply what I learned and port the proprietary drivers for Wifi and Ethernet (with hopefully HW-NAT). Priority on the Wifi since the open source MT76 still gives a lot of problems. Hopefully that will be sorted quickly, bug until then we can have options to use "less" open drivers.
 
Very good job, @drbrains ! You're doing amazing work . Getting HWnat and the proprietary wifi drivers would be amazing. The open source mt76 drivers in their current state is a bit of a let down unfortunately
 
It is possible to enable this by default on stable LEDE builds? I have some Marvell 88F6192 (from PopoPlug Mobile) and I am interested on using for OpenVPN endpoints too. Do you know if there similar steps to get it working on this SoC? It would be great to put a step-by-step instruction somewhere and keep it for reference. Thanks.
 
I did a quick google on tha chip. It should have some "security engine", but I couldn't find any driver / source code. Granted, since I don't have any Marvell based devices I didn't try for a long time. There should be some Linux driver for this engine, but to port it to the Lede SDK is not a simple to describe process. But you need done source code first.
 
Besides: there is a patch to disable al HW Engines and I haven't figured out yet, why someone decided like that?? For myself, I'm not using it in a high value environment, so for private use only at the moment until I understand why the HW was disabled. I don't want to open security holes even I found someone else doing it (remove the patch) dating back to 2013!
 
Sure. Keep in mind that I still have to clean it up. For now I just made dirty edits to e.g. the included header files. Not a big problem, since this engine ONLY works with the MT7628 Crypto engine in the SOC.
 
This is normal. For small blocks it takes more time to move the data into and out of the crypto module. Performance gain is with approximate block size of 1024 bytes and up. Why I showed the test with the "time -v" in front of the OpenSSL Speedtest was to show the amount of CPU bandwidth gained. 90% without vs 60% usage with the HW engine. Even if the speed would be the same, the "free" cpu cycles would be the benefit. With us doing more and more tasks on a router and getting faster and faster internet speeds, every cycle starts to count on limited devices.
 
As for real life, I am not sure how much performance is really gained using OpenVPN. I didn't get around to do proper testing. But even if it's just the 10-15% improvement as mentioned above and we win CPU cycles in the process, then why not. This resource is available on the SOC, so at least I wanted to have the option to use it.
 
The Nossiac drivers are proprietary wifi drivers and are not using the hardware crypto. Most MT7621 systems I've seen are using the MT7602 or MT7603 in combination with MT7612 for wifi. MT7628 has wifi in the SoC and is usually combined with the MT7612 as well.
 
My best guess is that LUKS is user space and only uses 512 Bytes sectors, so I assume this is the block size. On smaller blocks it doesn't make to much sense to use hardware. This is why nobody really bothered in the past I think. Those who need the performance will eventually switch to better hardware (maybe even x86) and get performance increases across the board.
 
@drbrains - I believe default luks uses aes-xts / 256b but will double check when i get back to the device. Real usage usb3 hdd, copy from/to files over samba was close to 12/13mb/sec which is close to the benchmarks i got.
 
Anyway thanks again for your work it should be usable for opessl/openssh so it should be beneficial for lots of people (even for scp or sock5 proxy over ssh). So maybe focus on "openssl speed" and encryption may come as added bonus.
 
I was able to compile and install openwrt-23.05.0-rc1-mediatek-filogic for M7981 based router, but I cannot see WLAN nor LAN ports up, they are not working.
ifconfig and wifi did not show any output.
 
EDIT ;
The device is not GL-iNet but it very similar to it.
when I downloaded GL-iNet firmware from GL website, the WLAN worked but the LAN did not work.
when I downloaded the firmware from Openwrt website, neither WLAN nor LAN worked.

what @Borromini is saying is:
almost every device with wifi chip have a radio calibration data partition
so if you flash some random image with some random partition table, you could erase ART partition and your board will be unusable
It is because ART partition is specific for each device and (mostly) could not be transfered from another (similar) one. This is factory calibration data for your wifi chip
 
How the mobile phone (that is off) informs the Windows PC (with installed drivers "MediaTek PreLoader USB VCOM port" and "MediaTek USB Port") how to identify itself: as device - "MediaTek PreLoader USB VCOM port" or as- "MediaTek USB Port"?
 
P.S This is "the phone off" state when battery is inside. What are correct names for those states (battery "in" and "outside")? When battery is extracted - device is not recognized as USB device by PC.
 
I have found a workaround where if I remove the module "modprobe -rv mt7921" and then shutdown the system tries to shut down but goes to a black screen without completely powering off. after a hard reset it boots back up again and voila the wifi is working again.
 
Is this a dual boot with Windows? If so, you need to make sure that fast boot is disabled. Windows saves devices state information to my wifi device that uses an MT7921e chip. I do not use it for dual boot anymore, and keep win11 in a virtual machine. The symptoms were the device not being recognized upon some reboots, but available on others.
The only way I found to get the device to be recognized on boot is to turn off the computer by holding the power button down for at least 30-60 seconds. The computer should completely turn off while you are doing this. It does not hurt while you are holding the button in to reach behind computer and turn off power switch at the PSU. You can flip it back on when you are done. If that does not work, as a last resort, try clearing CMOS with jumpers or removing the motherboard battery while the machine is removed from power cable. Your device, if not faulty, should be recognized on the next boot.
That being said, I no longer have this problem using it with only Linux on the system.
 
Hey rab thanks for the reply its not a duel boot and the wifi card has been playing well for since I bought the computer 9 months ago until now. The power off trick is interesting, perhaps that is why when I hard reset after removing the module it works for me??? I feel like its a bios or maybe firmware issue and if I update the bios and reinstall from a backup maybe it will fix it. I just thought I would check in with some experts first and try to understand my system before defaulting to reinstalling. That and my motherboard only supports bios updates from Windows. So its pretty annoying installing Windows just to update the bios. Definitely going to research more linux compatible computers before purchasing next time lol (2022 asus g14)
