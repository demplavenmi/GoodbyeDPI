In January 1917, British cryptographers deciphered a telegram from German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to the German Minister to Mexico, Heinrich von Eckhardt, offering United States territory to Mexico in return for joining the German cause. This message helped draw the United States into the war and thus changed the course of history. Read more...
 
**The Zimmermann Telegram on DocsTeach**asks students to analyze the telegram to determine if the United States should have entered World War I based on the telegram's information and implications.
 
Between 1914 and the spring of 1917, the European nations engaged in a conflict that became known as World War I. While armies moved across the face of Europe, the United States remained neutral. In 1916 Woodrow Wilson was reelected President for a second term, largely because of the slogan "He kept us out of war."
 
Events in early 1917 would change that hope. In frustration over the effective British naval blockade, Germany broke its pledge to limit submarine warfare on February 1, 1917. In response to the breaking of the Sussex pledge, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Germany. Several weeks later, on February 24, the British presented the Zimmermann telegram to the U.S. Government in an effort to capitalize on growing anti-German sentiment in the United States. The American press published news of the telegram on March 1. On April 6, 1917, the United States Congress formally declared war on Germany and its allies.

The Zimmermann Telegram had such an impact on American opinion that, according to David Kahn, author of The Codebreakers, "No other single cryptanalysis has had such enormous consequences." It is his opinion that "never before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message.
 
On March 1, 1917, the American public learned about a German proposal to ally with Mexico if the United States entered the war. Months earlier, British intelligence had intercepted a secret message from German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to the Mexican government, inviting an alliance (along with Japan) that would recover the southwestern states Mexico lost to the U.S. during the Mexican War of 1846-47.
 
What led to the proposal of alliance to Mexico? Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, an act the German government expected would likely lead to war with the U.S. Zimmermann hoped tensions with Mexico would slow shipments of supplies, munitions, and troops to the Allies if the U.S. was tied down on its southern border.
 
Some suspected the telegram might be a forgery to manipulate America into the war. However, on March 29, 1917, Zimmermann gave a speech in the Reichstag confirming the text of the telegram and so put an end to all speculation as to its authenticity.
 
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/yourbots\_name\_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.
 
You can use bots in telegram groups by just adding them to the group. You can find the group id by first adding a RawDataBot to your group. The Group id is shown as id in the "chat" section, which the RawDataBot will send to you:
 
When using telegram groups, you're giving every member of the telegram group access to your freqtrade bot and to all commands possible via telegram. Please make sure that you can trust everyone in the telegram group to avoid unpleasant surprises.
 
entry notifications are sent when the order is placed, while entry\_fill notifications are sent when the order is filled on the exchange.exit notifications are sent when the order is placed, while exit\_fill notifications are sent when the order is filled on the exchange.\*\_fill notifications are off by default and must be explicitly enabled.protection\_trigger notifications are sent when a protection triggers and protection\_trigger\_global notifications trigger when global protections are triggered.strategy\_msg - Receive notifications from the strategy, sent via self.dp.send\_msg() from the strategy more details.show\_candle - show candle values as part of entry/exit messages. Only possible values are "ohlc" or "off".
 
balance\_dust\_level will define what the /balance command takes as "dust" - Currencies with a balance below this will be shown.allow\_custom\_messages completely disable strategy messages.reload allows you to disable reload-buttons on selected messages.
 
Per default, the Telegram bot shows predefined commands. Some commandsare only available by sending them to the bot. The table below list theofficial commands. You can ask at any moment for help with /help.
 
The relative profit of 1.2% is the average profit per trade.The relative profit of 15.2 Σ% is be based on the starting capital - so in this case, the starting capital was 0.00485701 \* 1.152 = 0.00738 BTC.Starting capital is either taken from the available\_capital setting, or calculated by using current wallet size - profits.Profit Factor is calculated as gross profits / gross losses - and should serve as an overall metric for the strategy.Expectancy corresponds to the average return per currency unit at risk, i.e. the winrate and the risk-reward ratio (the average gain of winning trades compared to the average loss of losing trades).Expectancy Ratio is expected profit or loss of a subsequent trade based on the performance of all past trades.Max drawdown corresponds to the backtesting metric Absolute Drawdown (Account) - calculated as (Absolute Drawdown) / (DrawdownHigh + startingBalance).Bot started date will refer to the date the bot was first started. For older bots, this will default to the first trade's open date.
 
You can get a list of all open trades by calling /forceexit without parameter, which will show a list of buttons to simply exit a trade.This command has an alias in /fx - which has the same capabilities, but is faster to type in "emergency" situations.
 
If a market direction is provided the command updates the user managed variable that represents the current market direction.This variable is not set to any valid market direction on bot startup and must be set by the user. The example below is for /marketdir long:
 
As this value/variable is intended to be changed manually in dry/live trading.Strategies using market\_direction will probably not produce reliable, reproducible results (changes to this variable will not be reflected for backtesting). Use at your own risk.
 
This is also significant because it is the first (or one of the first) contributions of a non-DFINITY-employee to a core IC component, and shows that the Internet Computer project is really becoming a community project.
 
I wonder if it would make sense to keep a list of non-DFINITY contributions, at least until they become too abundant to count. This gives the contributors extra motivation due to the bragging right and at the same time demonstrates that community contributions are indeed possible. WDYT, @diego?
 
My telegram canister, GitHub - nomeata/ic-telegram-bot: A telegram bot on the Internet Computer, handles this request, and decodes the JSON using an existing Telegram Rust library (big for using existing programming languages on-chain here) to peek inside. It looks in the message text for /telljoke, extracts the jokes, remembers it, and replies a response with upgrade.
 
The reply is an IC-style reply, and is received by the icx-proxy. It notices that upgrade = true, and instead of simply producing a HTTP response like usual, this flag causes it to issue another call to the canister, but this time an update call to the http\_request\_update method. This is the new feature added by @paulyoung.
 
.ic0.app is meant for certified access, to remedy that problem. Here, upon first access by a browser, a service worker is installed that teaches the browser to check special certificates returned by the canister that prove that the response body is correct. Unfortunately, this only works with browsers, and is of no help at all when you want to provide a HTTP API to other servers. At least not until they all learn about the IC (but then they could do IC-level calls directly anyways).
 
This looks like it
