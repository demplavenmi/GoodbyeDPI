Since they decided to introduce a marketing angle into the movie, they should have seen it through to the end. From watching the Christmas carnival, would anyone have guessed that the lights or the concert was sponsored by the cable company? No.

When and how much exactly did Ugo borrow and why did he borrow the money? No background was given, they just expected us to put 2 and 2 together to get 5. If Obi was able to pay off the loan with just his promotion advance, that means it was not a lot of money, so what exactly was all the fuss about?
 
Finally, this movie was quite elitist. It was a group of rich people doing CSR, we did not see anyone of them relate with these people in the ghetto, the look of superiority and disgust did not change till the very end. I am of the opinion that the Christmas warmth and affection peculiar to Christmas movies was missing.
 
Nigerian movies are experiencing a resurgence due to the high demand in quality from cinemas and in turn, our Nigerian movie producers that have dreams of debuting in cinema have also responded in kind by releasing quality movies at least some of the time.

The only thing the movie had wrong was the over-the-top performance mostly by its female protagonists, but 30 minutes into the movie, it becomes a foregone conclusion that the only way to sell the characters was to actually be over the top because of the nature of the movie.
 
The production and cinematography are very well done as well as the fight choreography, the fights are exactly what you would expect from a Yoruba movie comical and yet brutal. The movie centres on its main character, Lefty, an adopted child of a wealthy Lagos aristocrat.
 
While this backstory would have been a joy to see on screen, we just have to make do with us being told about it. Lefty and her gang of ghetto amazons played by Eniola Badmus, Chioma Chukwuka, Bimbo Thomas, and the famous singer, Yemi Alade make their way through the harsh reality of ghetto life in Lagos as petty criminals and hustlers.
 
Against their warnings, their leader, Lefty maintains a long term relationship with a con man played by Deyemi Okanlawon, their relationship leads to Lefty having a run-in with the law, and so, the story begins.
