That will ask some tears in the true performing of it: if I do it,let the audience look to their eyes; I will move storms, I willcondole in some measure.... I could play Ercles rarely, or a partto tear a cat in, to make all split...a lover is more condoling.
 
You, Muriel, were in some sort a predestined victim, since you wrotewith me the play to which this novel is but the limbs and outwardflourishes; my debt and your long-suffering are all the greater. You,Helen and Bar, were wantonly sacrificed on the altar of that friendshipof which the female sex is said to be incapable; let the lie stick i'the wall!
 
It has been said, by myself and others, that a love-interest is only anintrusion upon a detective story. But to the characters involved, thedetective-interest might well seem an irritating intrusion upon theirlove-story. This book deals with such a situation. It also provides somesort of answer to many kindly inquiries as to how Lord Peter and hisHarriet solved their matrimonial problem. If there is but a ha'porth ofdetection to an intolerable deal of saccharine, let the occasion be theexcuse.
 
So Peter is really married: I have ordered willow-wreaths for half myacquaintance. I understand that it is a deciduous tree; if nothing isavailable but the bare rods, I shall distribute them all the same, forthe better beating of breasts.
 
Well, my dear, we shall see what we shall see, and you may be sure Ishall do my best for Peter's wife, if only to spite Helen, who willdoubtless make everything as unpleasant as possible for her newsister-in-law. Naturally, I pay no attention to her snobbish nonsenseabout misalliances, which is ridiculous and out-of-date. Compared withthe riff-raff we are getting in now from the films and the night-clubs,a country doctor's daughter, even with a poet in her past, is a miracleof respectability. If the young woman has brains and bowels, she willsuit well enough. Do you suppose they intend to have any children? Helenwill be furious if they do, as she has always counted on Peter's moneygoing to Saint-George. Denver, if I know anything about him, will bemore concerned to secure the succession in case Saint-George breaks hisneck in that car of his. Whatever they do, somebody will be indignant,so I imagine they will please themselves.
 
Thank you for your kind inquiries. Tuesday was indeed a most exhaustingday, though I am feeling rather more[Pg 18] rested this evening. But it hasbeen a very trying time for all of us. Peter, of course, was just astiresome as he could be, and that is saying a good deal. First of all,he insisted on being married in church, though, considering everything,I should have thought the Registrar's Office would have been moreappropriate. However, we resigned ourselves to St. George's, HanoverSquare, and I was prepared to do everything in my power to see that thething was done properly, if it had to be done at all. But mymother-in-law took it all out of my hands, though I am sure we weredistinctly given to understand that the wedding would take place on theday *I* had suggested, that is, next Wednesday. But this, as you willsee, was just one of Peter's monkey tricks. I feel the slight *verymuch*, particularly as we had gone out of our way to be civil to thegirl, and had asked her to dinner.
 
The whole business has left us in a most painful and ridiculousposition. I consider it a disgraceful ending to a most disastrousaffair, and it is no consolation to think that I shall have to producethis appalling young woman as my sister-in-law. Mary's policeman was badenough, but he is, at any rate, quiet and well behaved; whereas, withPeter's wife, we may look for notoriety, if not for open scandal, fromone day to another. However, we must put as good a face on it as we can;I wouldn't say as much as I *have* said to anybody but you.
 
I write from an "unknown destination" in the country, hoping this findsyou as it leaves me. Owing to a[Pg 21] trifling domestic catastrophe, I haveonly a candle to see by, so trust you will excuse my bad writing.
 
Well, Mother, we were happily married this morning and a very prettywedding it was. I only wish you could have been present at hislordship's kind invitation, but as I said to him, at eighty-seven somephysical infirmities are only to be expected. I hope your leg is better.
 
As I told you in my last, we were all set to escape Her Grace'sinterfering ways, and so we did, everything going off like clockwork.Her new ladyship, Miss Vane that was, went down to Oxford the daybefore, and his lordship with Lord Saint-George and myself followed inthe evening, staying at the Mitre. His lordship spoke very kindly to meindeed, alluding to my twenty years' service, and trusting that I shouldfind myself comfortable in the new household. I told him I hoped I knewwhen I was well suited, and should endeavour to give satisfaction. I amafraid I said more than was my place, for his lordship was sincerelyaffected and told me not to be a bloody fool. I took the liberty toprescribe a dose of bromide and got him to sleep at last, when I couldpersuade his young lordship to leave him alone. Considerate is not theterm I would employ of Lord Saint-George, but some of his teasing mustbe put down to the champagne.
 
His lordship appeared calm and resolute in the morning, which was agreat relief to my mind, there being a good deal to do. A number ofhumble friends arriving by special transport, it was my task to see thatthey were made comfortable and not permitted to lose themselves.
 
Well, dear Mother, we partook of a light and early lunch, and then I hadto get their lordships dressed and down to the church. My own gentlemanwas as quiet as a lamb and gave no trouble, not even his usual joking,but Lord St.-G. was in tearing high spirits and I had my hands full withhim. He pretended five times that he had lost the ring, and just as wewere setting out he mislaid[Pg 22] it in earnest; but his lordship, with hiscustomary detective ability, discovered it for him and took charge of itpersonally. In spite of this misadventure, I had them at the chancelsteps dead on time, and I will say they both did me credit. I do notknow where you would beat his young lordship for handsome looks, thoughto my mind there is no comparison which is the finer gentleman.
 
The lady did not keep us waiting, I am thankful to say, and very wellshe looked, all in gold, with a beautiful bouquet of chrysanthemums. Sheis not pretty, but what you would call striking-looking, and I am sureshe had no eyes for anyone but his lordship. She was attended by fourladies from the College, not dressed as bridesmaids, but all neat andladylike in appearance. His lordship was very serious all through theceremony.
 
Then we all went back to a reception at Her Grace the Dowager's Townhouse. I was very much pleased with her new ladyship's behaviour towardsthe guests, which was frank and friendly to all stations, but, ofcourse, his lordship would not
