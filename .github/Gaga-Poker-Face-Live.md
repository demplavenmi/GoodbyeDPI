Gaga performed the song on the eighth season of the television show *American Idol*, besides multiple other television appearances, as well as the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, all of her concert tours, and the Super Bowl LI halftime show. "Poker Face" was nominated for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the 52nd Grammy Awards, and won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.
 
"Poker Face" was written by Gaga and RedOne, while production was handled also by RedOne.[1] Gaga stated in an interview that "Poker Face" was written by her as a pop song and was a tribute to her "rock 'n' roll boyfriends". She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling.[2] When *Rolling Stone* magazine asked about the meaning of the line "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained that it really was a metaphor for her vulva, noting "it's my pussy's poker face!". She added that it came from a lyric "Blueberry kisses, the muffin man misses them kisses" from an unreleased track called "Blueberry Kisses" where a girl wanted her boyfriend to perform cunnilingus on her.[3]
 
During her Fame Ball Tour performance at Palm Springs, California, on April 11, 2009, Gaga explained to the crowd the true meaning behind the term "Poker Face" used in the song. She suggested that the song dealt with her personal experience with bisexuality. The idea behind the song was to be with a man but fantasizing about a woman, hence the man in the song needs to read her "Poker Face" to understand what is going through her mind.[4]

"Poker Face" is a synth-pop[5] and dance-pop[6] song, and follows the footsteps of Gaga's previous single "Just Dance".[5] Whereas "Just Dance" was predominately electropop, "Poker Face" carries a dark sound with clear vocals on the chorus and a pop hook[7] while combining the synths from "Just Dance" and the more dance-oriented beat of the next single "LoveGame".[8] According to Kerri Mason of *Billboard*, the composition "carr[ies] the pleather-and-sequins vibe of the downtown New York scene out of the underground and onto the FM dial without losing its smut and sass."[9]
 
Lyrically, "Poker Face" is all about sexual innuendo and teasing.[7] According to *Daily Star*, the chorus repeats two alternating lyrics. After the hook "Can't read my Poker Face" the backup singer says "He's got me like nobody" and then in the next line says "She's got me like nobody". Gaga explained in an interview with them that the line carries a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex.[12] However, the liner notes from the album booklet indicate both these lines only repeat "she's got me like nobody".[1] According to BBC, the "Mum-mum-mum-mah" hook used in the song references Boney M.'s 1977 hit "Ma Baker".[13]
 
Slant Magazine music reviewer Sal Cinquemani included "Poker Face" among the songs that work in *The Fame*, namely tracks like "Starstruck," "Paper Gangsta" and "Summerboy".[17] Matthew Chisling from Allmusic called the song "infectious" and along with the title track "The Fame", complimented them for "rejuvenating the vibe on the album for its second half."[18] Andy Downing from *The Chicago Tribune* called the song "jaunty" while reviewing Gaga's Fame Ball tour.[19] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters.com felt that "Poker Face" along with the track "Paparazzi", duplicate much of the same "glitzy territory that previous single 'Just Dance' had covered, but never once does it feel like Gaga is deliberately repeating herself."[20] *Rolling Stone* in a review for The Fame Ball Tour compared the live acoustic "bluesy" version of "Poker Face" with the music of singer Amy Winehouse.[21] Erika Hobert from the *New Times Broward-Palm Beach* newspaper called the song "trashtastic Europop."[22] The song was nominated for Grammy Awards in the categories for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Dance Recording, ultimately winning the last of these.[23][24]
