We can turn to theological categories and creeds to help guide our interpretations. We know this passage cannot mean that Jesus is not God because we affirm Jesus as fully God and fully Man in our confessions of faith.
 
A theological reading of the Bible recognizes that we are not lone ranger Christians reading the Bible outside of the helps God has provided through teachers and the creeds, confessions, and books they have written.
 
If we return to Psalm 1, we can read it transformationally by asking these questions: What is God calling me to do in response to these two ways to live? What kind of person is God inviting me to become through the habit of meditating on Scripture? How might this psalm shape my goals and values? What areas of my life does this psalm challenge me to reconsider and redirect toward God?

How Revelation gives hope to Christians todayGuest ContributorWhen you consider the book of Revelation, are you immediately overwhelmed by mysterious symbolism and terrifying images? When you read about worldwide earthquakes and trumpeting angels, monstrous beasts,...
 
Thank you for sharing the three ways for better interpretatint the Bible. And thanks for reemphasing the ultimate goal in pursuing this journey of live like Jesus is to be transformed to be more like Jesus.
 
The books in the Bible were written by the ancient writers to various ancient audiences in various literary styles, with various intends within the various historical and cultural settings at the time of writing.
 
About four years ago, I read the Bible cover-to-cover for the first time. I explained how I did it. It took me 100 days, and yes, as a result, I became a Christian. Since then, I have not stopped reading it. I read it again three more times, and I am now on a fifth pass through. I think I can explain how (and why) to undertake this task, in FAQ form.

(1) It will make you better educated. The Bible is the most important and influential book in the history of the world, bar none. No other book even comes close in influence, especially for Western culture. The more familiar I am with the Bible, the most amazed I am when I reflect that it is not more regularly required as a part of basic education.
 
(2) It might just be true. My own view is that it is the most amazing and profound book ever written. Billions of people, including many brilliant ones, have agreed with that assessment. And if it is true, reading it might prove instrumental to your eternal salvation.
 
There is a sweet spot, I think, that involves reading carefully (maybe each chapter twice), using references to clarify words and puzzling names, looking up answers to hard questions, and reading/viewing book introductions of modest length. Much more than that, and on your first pass, you might burn out. But if you lightly pass your eyes over the words and never consult any references such as study Bibles, maps, encyclopedia articles, or introductory lectures, you will definitely find it puzzling and will almost certainly not understand it. That will also make you give up.
 
These four components each solve a different problem. The Bible itself is the object of study. The study Bible answers common questions and provides sometimes indispensable stage-setting to particular sections, chapters, and verses. Maps and encyclopedias are essential for understanding name references. And without some sort of broad intros to books, you will almost certainly not understand what is going on. They give essential background and do stage-setting.
 
Et cetera. From a very limited (not to mention disrespectful and faithless) point of view, the whole thing looks boring. But the more you understand it, the more you understand that it is an integrated whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
 
What can you skim the first time through? Those genealogical lists, lists of tribal leaders and their censuses and cities, descriptions and re-descriptions of tabernacle and temple construction (and their furniture and priestly vestments), land allotments and boundaries, lists of cities, and detailed, repetitive descriptions of sacrifices.
 
Regardless, do read what book introductions and study Bibles say about even these more eye-glazing bits. Find out what they are lists and descriptions of, at least, and why they were considered important. They can become more meaningful on later passes through. Not to brag or anything, but I have read and studied the Bible enough that many of the name lists and sacrifice instructions have started to become downright interesting.
 
Hi Lary,  
I hope you are well.  
I have a question about the Bible. Have you encountered any contradictions in the Bible that raise some questions?  
Honest answer please  
Many thanks

In the years leading up to my read-through, I was softening up. It was not a totally sudden thing. One key event in my shifting perspective was this essay, which led to this a couple years later. I also came to believe that Christianity was a positive influence on culture (see this and this).
 
Larry, I have been a Christian for almost 2 years now. I was raised in a secular (somewhat conservative) Western European household. I was forwarded to this website from your Wikipedia page and saw that you were not always Christian. Since when do you profess and possess the faith, how did it all happen, and what denomination/theology do you adhere the most to? God bless you in all you do!
 
I love reading. And being a parent of three daughters has further convinced me of the value of reading. When my girls were little, my favorite time of the day was reading time with them, just before they went to bed.
 
**4. Enter a loving conversation with God**: Respond to God in prayer. Enter loving conversation with him. Make this a dialogue, not a monologue. Verbalize and, if you desire, journal your prayers. Express your prayers through the spoken word, journaling, artistry, or any other way you want.
 
**6. Join with Jesus in his mission:** This prayer has mission at its core. Join with the Father and Son and Holy Spirit in the missio Dei. Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Express mission afresh. Respond in missional ways to your reading and prayer. Allow your prayerful reading of the Bible to shape your theology and practice of mission. Go individually. But, more importantly, go in community. Missio and communio are interdependent. Our mission is in communion with the triune God and his people. And mission makes our communion real and rich and dynamic.
 
**8. Contemplate and rest in the loving presence of God:**Rest in the presence of God. Be thankful. Contemplate discipleship. Contemplate new missional actions, habits, practices, commitments, and theology. Do this individually, and, preferably, with others. Respond. Embrace repentance and change and restored relationships. Pursue fresh commitments, new missional outlooks and practices, and so on. Contemplation must lead to gazing on Jesus Christ. So, this is not the end of a process, but the beginning of a new cycle of missional reading (lectio missio).
 
Missional reading is a process, a cycle, and a dance, that will reactivate your missional vitality. When practiced together, it can also inspire your friends, family, team, and church to join in the mission of God.
 
We were encouraged to spend about 30 minutes every day reading our Bibles and praying, using this notebook as we went. I followed this method and it formed a consistent habit of Bible reading in my life.
 
Then I went to Bible college and spent hours in the classroom and in the library learning how to study the Bible to not only understand it, but in order to teach it. There was a lot more to it than just answering those two questions or even color-coding my notes. I loved it. It was thrilling to see the Bible come even more alive than it had before as I uncovered the meanings of Greek words, researched the historical and cultural context of books of the Bible, and discussed difficult passages of Scripture with professors and classmates.
 
As I began this combination of quiet time/Bible study, I realized I needed something that was more like a workbook, not a pretty journal. I study my Bible curled up in my comfy chair, not at a desk, so it needed to be relatively small, durable, and have lots of space. I have ample room to take notes, places to store anything that might be pertinent to my study, and everything is in one place.
 
AN ENGAGED MIND & A TEACHABLE SPIRIT: This is critical. We need to come to the Bible with an eagerness to learn, but also a willingness to allow the Holy Spirit to transform our hearts in the process.
 
I always start at the beginning of a book and work my way through. Topical studies of the Bible can be helpful, but we first need to increase our comprehension of the Bible in its entirety. We need a foundation of Biblical literacy that can only be formed as we study the Bible in context. This is where we need to begin, and studying an entire book at one time is the best way to start.
