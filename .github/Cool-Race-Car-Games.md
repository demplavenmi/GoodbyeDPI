In the fifth chapter, Abdul Khabeer discusses the employment of hip hop and Muslim hip hop artists by the U.S. government to deliver a message of successful multiculturalism and democracy abroad, but these artists are not given the space to be critical of U.S. foreign policy (213). Muslim hip hop artists use these trips not only to generate needed income, but also to build networks and foster the creation of a worldwide community of hip hop artists (214).
 
In addition to this book and several academic articles, Abdul Khabeer published a performance ethnography titled Sampled: Beats of Muslim Life, which is a one-woman performance designed to present her research on race and gender, religion, popular culture, and citizenship in the United States. She is also the founder of sapelosquare.com, which is an online publication committed to providing documentation and analysis of the African-American Muslim experience. Abdul Khabeer is currently an associate professor of Anthropology and African American Studies at Purdue University.

[3] According to Abdul Khabeer, the Five Percent Nation of Gods and Earths emerged in the 1960s as a spiritual movement by a former youth minister in the Nation of Islam, Clarence 13X or Father Allah. It is a separate movement from the Nation of Islam. On the Five Percenters see, M. M. Knight and Felicia M. Miyakawa.

The March 6th edition of Way too Cool 50K is postponed as the State of CA is still not allowing outdoor races to operate. We will continue to work with our local elected officials and hope to get permit visibility as soon as possible.
 
This race has become the most sought after 50K in the United States for veterans and novices alike. The breathtaking trails, spirited aid stations, amazing views and pure fun, make this an adventure you won't want to miss.
 
Heartfelt thanks and sincere gratitude to the Western States Endurance Run Foundation, Western States Trail Foundation, Robie Foundation and the California Forest Foundation for their help in clearing and maintaining the trails to afford each of us an opportunity to run and enjoy.

I just came back from a race weekend at Summit Point where it was Africa hot. Air temps were 100F+ with humidity to match and on the blacktop it was just suffocating. In a black tin can sitting in the sun, on the blacktop with the exhaust cooking the floor... really, really unpleasant.
 
I was sweating thru my suit before we even left the grid. I managed a good start in the feature race anyway... worked my way from 16th into the top 10... on pace to do even better. By lap 17 or so I started getting light headed and shakey. I held on to the end but I had to concede my way all the way back to 13th about 2 sec off the pace. Needless to say... pretty disappointing after fighting so hard to get the spots. When I got out of the car I threw up and had to ice down. It took a good hour before I was able to return to normal.
 
OK, so... I know, everyone on the grid has a Cool Suit and I'm an idiot for not just buying one but... they are $$$ and it isn't always 100F. I might only need it once a year. I have a shoestring budget as it is. The cooler part looks easy to make - the shirt, appears easy but I can't sew. My initial plan is buy a shirt and fabricate the pump/cooler to save half the cost but... what DIY solutions does the GRM Elite use to keep from dying of heat stroke? There weren't always CoolSuits. What do you folks who race in the southern tier use to survive and keep your wits sharp over a whole race?
 
Also, seal all vents from the engine bay and apply stick on heat shielding around the worst part of the exhaust on the firewall/front floor to keep the heat radiating away from the cabin. Sealing all vents will prevent hot engine bay heat from dumping into the cabin, I can't tell you how much nicer it was to not have 120F air blowing on my feet/legs during AutoX after sealing the car up.
 
Pedialite in a water bottle with tube to your mouth to replace the electrolytes you're losing--and what you felt as you faded in the race. Paint at least the roof of the car white. Wait as late as you can before putting on the helmet. Store the balaclava in a cooler with lots of ice--h it in a baggie to keep it dry, of course. Heat shield placed between the exhaust and underside of the car--even if it's just half an inch gap, it'll help. And, look for ways to duct the air out of the cockpit. Consult the rule book first, then a couple of NACA ducts in the rear side windows. Mega-hydrate before the race.
 
I'm seen these Head band/Neck bands. You throw them in the freezer. If you don't wear a hans, you could put it on the back of your neck and that should help a great deal.Or build a swamp cooler for the car. -12V-Air-Conditioner---Cheap-and-easy!/Duct the exhaust from the cooler at your neck.If you want to get fancy take a pump and put a line or two in your seat lining to help keep things cool.
 
I actually did try to over-hydrate. I probably had 32oz of gatoraide and 2 gal of water between 7am and the race. I run 30 miles a week at lunchtime so I do exercise in what heat is available - it just isn't that kind of heat. Without all that I bet I would not have finished at all.
 
Find one of those shirts that has all the little freezer packs in them. Get 2 or 3 and keep them in the freezer at home, then transfer them to your cooler ,but in a freezer bag to keep the shirt dry. Put it on as close to your race start as possible.
 
@ beaverun chumpcar i saw naca ducts with hoses ending near drivers seat, and even a floor register looking sheetmetal vent duct chopped through the roof at top of windshield. that would provide ridiculous airflow at speed, but is probably not what you're looking for.
 
The home made cool shirt makes a world of difference. My June 2010 race at Summit Point was a similar situation, with horrible air flow into the car. Flipping the cool shirt pump on resulted in a rush of coolness over my entire torso. That was a cotton t-shirt with tubing sewn onto it, a cooler, a 12v bilge pump, wiring, fasteners, ice, and water. Significantly less than $100 for everything and it made the 45 minute stint in the car go from "unbearable" to "comfortable." I wouldn't consider the investment just driver comfort, it's actually safety.
 
Consider getting a Kwik Kool system from Speedway. I have the system that uses cans of refrigerant that you dispense as needed. No cooler, no plumbing and about $200. 1 can is good for a race and costs about $11. I've had mine for several yyears and am very satisfied with it.
 
I know it's awful, but I'm living in the same heat (Arlington) and don't see how the hell you could race in these conditions. My daily 5-10 mile runs are suffering badly. That said- how much would having working a/c affect your lap times? I'm guessing in the miata it will have a pretty large effect, but on a larger-engined car- does anyone have a guess? MotoIQ says that the C.6R Lemans car has a/c, but it's mostly due to rules that require the inside of the car to be no more than 10 deg higher than ambient outside temp.
 
$269 for cooler, shirt, etc. DIY is still a lot cheaper, but this is worth a look if you're not totally strapped for cash. I would spend this before racing in 100 degree heat with no cooler system at all.
 
Oh, and RE: the A/C system: without some ducting directing the air into your suit, you're not likely to get much benefit from working a/c. I assume that like most racing series the windows have to be down. It might help a bit, but not as much as a cool shirt.
 
HELMET blower makes the biggest difference of all the stuff i tried. It's not cold but pushes the heat out of your head.My 1st Home brew was a 3" brake duct fan ($28) and a plastic soda bottle cut the bottom off and taped the funnel part to the blower then off to HD for dish washer drain hose. Cut to fit leaving the rubber end for the helmet the plastic hose part screwed on to the coke bottle cap. Darn thing worked great! I ordered several other units like parker pumper and one from speedway when i had extra $$ but sent them back as they moved less air! then my $40 home made unit. sold the car over the winter and left itThis year i was missing it so i bought a cool shirt brand unit with the 235CFM fan....same brand blower i used in my home brew but is 4' diameter not 3" It does move some air but at $120 I should have just built a new home built.One thing i've been looking at is a SCR type heat sink cooler. It's a semi conductor that when you apply 12v it will heat one side of the heat sink to 140deg but the oposite side cools to 50deg I might just buy a unit and place the cold side in the air intake od the blower.I found a place that sells them cheap...
 
That rule change was because drivers were coming in after long, hot stints, and some couldn't remember even pulling into the pits, and/or barely being able to get out of the cars. And, the lap times did go up. IIIRC, there's a max interior temp for the cars, outside temp doesn't factor in at all.
