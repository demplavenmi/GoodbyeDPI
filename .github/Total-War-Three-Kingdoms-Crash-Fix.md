**I've been negative to Discord the last year or so, thinking of deleting the Discord because of a lack of activity anyway.**

**But if you're wondering it's not my own Discord channels that I'm writing about, I mean I think that the Warcraft: Total War Discord is inactive in which i hardly ever get responses on anything in 2024, and this is unlike in 2021 and earlier when any post about the development of Warcraft received replies.**

**The fact the Discord is so inactive has made me consider deleting it though..**

**But the Discord Channel I am mainly negative about is of course the Medieval 2 Modder's Discord where the Admins have bullied me since at least the spring 2021, by banning and blocking me a lot. And it all started with a political discussion about Ukraine that later ended up discussing politics in general, where obviously people may have different opinions, so many of the modder's there didn't like me very much after I stated I was against certain politics.**

**Anyway, in 2024 it has nothing to do with politics - but politics is what caused a divide in that Discord between people who don't like me and people who do.**

**In 2024 I feel they're just stupid. I just got banned from the Discord for stating a comment was retarded, in which a user (not an admin) made fun of me saying "I can't write about the entire issue with adding a certain Faerun-model to Faerun: Total War in one single sentence", this was after I had posted more than one post about my issues in the "Model's and Animations"-channel where you're supposed to post when you have troubles. An admin demanded I'd keep to one single sentence, and "Warned me" - I answered that it's impossible to stick to one sentence, after which a guy who wasn't an admin made fun of me by writing "You're saying you can't post sentences" - which received "laughing smiles" - after which I called his comment retarded, and after that they kicked me out of the Discord!**

**So yeah, Discord as a service has only been bad for relations between modders.**
 
I used to be one of the admins in that Discord prior to the political discussion in 2022? I wrote 2021 earlier but I believe there was another issue in 2021 between me and one modder about the Narnia: Total War update that we had been working on, where I had been given sole control of the project after the other modder said he was out. So I handed permissions to another modder to do my "work" for me and then the modder who had left the project, who had made the models, got mad because I had "given away his models" - when in reality I had only given away the work.

**On TWC this wasn't a problem because modders only wrote in threads regarding their own projects, or in the bugs and issues-related threads where they all shared the same issue. You could never write "too much" there. Plus in a TWC-thread you had to make longer single posts because it wasn't a chat, so you ended up reading other people's posts, then posting your own - then waited on answers which could take any length of time.**

**But as Discord is a chat it's easy to post multiple posts, and everyone will be able to read it, so unlike on TWC you'd have every single med2 modder there, and many med2 players - in the same Discord, whilst on TWC members/modders hang out in their own mod-threads and only entered other areas if they themselves shared the same issues.**

**Me and Bantu also used Skype between 2017 to late 2018 when developing the mod, and the benefit with Skype was that things were kept between the developers, whilst on Discord a lot of other people can see and read everything so you quickly make more people dislike you there, if they side with whoever you have a problem with.**

**Yes, I believe that on TWC it was easy to be popular as a modder but on Discord it's easy to become impopular. Discord sucks as such.**
 
I want to state that my modding has been taking up most of my free time since the beginning of the year 2016, and I've been doing music sub-mods for Wrath of the Norsemen, Divide and Conquer, The last Kingdom: Wrath of the Norsemen and Warcraft Total War, then I've also done real sub-mods of other mods like the following sub-mods - The Last Kingdom: Wrath of the Norsemen, Hyrule Total War: Classic Ultimate, Wrath of the Norsemen: Factions United Sub-Mod, Game of Thrones: Total War Enhanced Version 4.0+ (and I weren't alone in every project, with GoT I had a partner who did the models and the unit cards, the symbols and such - but I did the coding and also quite a few family portraits) - with the music sub-mods I spent entire days on each faction/cultures music and they were very detailed - with the sub-mods I've spent months on each, with Hyrule that's most of the years December 2018-July 2021 - even though most of the modding was done in 2018-2021 - only the strat-model package in 2021..

And that's without mentioning Warcraft: Total War - a mod which only had very little when I started the new project in March 2017 and were joined by two old team-members and three new ones. The creator of the map left after updating it one final time during the summer of 2017, the first modeller did the Warcraft 3 models, and the improved human models - then he left as well - then we were 4 people remaining doing most of the work until the release in April 2018. During 2018 another main release was worked on and during that fall it was me and Bantu who did everything - WarcraftHero did do some unit cards in the final days before the release in December though. 

To put this in perspective, this is what the mod looked like in March 2017:



Needless to say a huge amount of work was needed here - and while others did the quotes, the models in battle, some of the strat-models, the loading screens, the family tree's, the starting family members, fixing, certain scripts etc - I did code about 400 models into the mod, I implemented the videos and edited them, I made 150 unit cards at least, I did the majority of the gameplay of the campaign - especially all the Frozen Throne-stuff - and I did lead the mod team and keep track of every single version etc. I did a lot, if my work was removed from the mod it would not be playable - Bantu, who rigged the majority of the models since May 2017, stated that he didn't have the patience to code all of them into the game - it's done in an oldschool way using Notepad++ - it takes forever to code all of those models and their entries in every file into the game - half the work was doing the coding - and the other half was doing the models - everything else was just additional work that didn't require as much time or effort. Of course the map itself took work but TheHappyCrusader created it back in 2009-2012 - it already existed. He then updated it a little during the summer of 2017 but it still had a gamebreaking bug and had about 40 regions at the time - to my memory I added all the new regions, placed out the new factions, fixed the gamebreaking bug.. (A bug where the game would crash whenever the Legion attacked Stormwind, or Stormwind attacked the Legion in the grey area of Medivh.)

The development did take most of the year March 29th 2017- April 23rd 2018 before we even had a release - maybe 10 months of work that year alone - in 2018 me and Bantu were extremely active between August and December. In 2019 I did a smaller update in February. In 2020 the same - and in 2021 the mod received 56 new strat-models that I made 100% out of Bantu's battle-models. That required about a month of modding too. 

Bantu, who did rig more than 400 of the battle-models - is the other half of the majority of the work - I don't count the map because it was created by the old team prior to the new project - the map already existed back in 2012 unlike the rest of the mod.
 
**Warcraft: Total War is based in the Warcraft universe by Blizzard Entertainment. The setting for the mod is based around the Warcraft III Reign of Chaos - Warcraft III Frozen Throne, and will contain a large map containing dozens of iconic provinces, along with factions very distinct from each other such as the Scourge, the Horde, the Burning Legion, as well as many units and heroes essential to any Warcraft experience.**
 
First and foremost, the mod IS a continuation of the original project started by TheHappyCrusader, which is why we are still using this Moddb page. However, the revival was possible due to an almost entirely new set of people, and they have their own unique twists and changes to the original vision intended for the mod. Therefore it is safe to say that this is a NEW mod indeed. In essence using the old one merely as a base from which to expand, re-utilizing whatever assets and ideas we could salvage.

**A:**It did say "don't play it". The download currently available is from the old incarnation of the mod. As stated above in this list, it has no relation to the current version, apart from having been used as a base for its development. You can download it if you want, if you are curious about it, or simply if you want to take a look at the campaign map. Perhaps you would like to even create your own version of WTW using that as a base. In any case, do not expect that download to be playable by any means.
