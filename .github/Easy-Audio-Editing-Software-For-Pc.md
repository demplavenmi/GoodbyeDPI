Listeners have high expectations for professional audio, making dedicated software essential for businesses, creators, and audio engineers. There are plenty of options on the market from the likes of Adobe and Apple, popular with professionals who demand studio-quality results. However, these usually need a subscription or one-off license fee. Luckily, there are plenty of free audio editors for download.

We've tested all the best audio editors and free alternatives to find the best free audio editors with the best results without costing you anything. As part of our review process, we explored the editing and mixing experience, compared production tools, sound libraries, and bundled music samples, and checked professional features such as VST support and multi-track editing. We've also highlighted where services offer optional paid upgrades, but we've made sure all our recommendations are free to use. .
 
Multi-platform and a delight to use, it excels at simplifying the editing and organizing process through scrubbing tools and markers to find the clips and cuts you need. On the other hand, the audio editor only offers one-track recording and no mixer - this is available via a separate app, MixPad Multi-Track Audio Mixer, accessed via WavePad.
 
Audiotool unlocks audio editing right in your browser (so long as that browser is Chrome - officially, at least, as it reportedly works in Firefox and Edge). That means you have access to your audio clips wherever you are. No waiting to download and install from a new computer. A Chrome extension is also available.
 
Modify your tracks with Audiotool by adding filters from a selection of 14 different effects. You can also create a MIDI controller within the program or use a splitter tool to attenuate and modify your audio signal.

The site, which places an emphasis on community and collaboration, features user-made music uploads created in Audiotool, giving you a taste of the possibilities with this software for editing audio.
 
When choosing which free audio editor is best for you, start by focusing on the tools and features you need to create your soundscape. Some of the very best free audio editors are almost as powerful as paid-for alternatives, while others are better for minor edits and less complex projects. As part of this, also look at the types of formats you work in and which free audio editing apps offer the right filetype support
 
Consider your experience and skill-level, too. Some free options are very accessible for novices, while others, though free, are best used by professional sound designers and engineers familiar with in-depth interfaces, tools. and features.
 
When testing the best free audio editors and music production software, we assess all the areas that matter to you. To start, that means looking at pricing - a free audio editor must be genuinely free to use. Any payments or subscription upgrades need to be clearly sign-posted, with no hidden or unclear charges.
 
We extensively explore user interface and user experience. All software, including audio editors, should be clear to use and intuitive to navigate. Even more advanced tools, such as those aimed at the professional market, should provide documentation so users can get started with minimal disruption.
 
Bracing for a good four or five hours of rewinding and writing and rewinding, I remembered that this is The Future! So, instead, I tossed the job over to the global anonymous workforce at Amazon Mechanical Turk instead.
 
This is a fraction of the cost/time of any other transcription service online, including the Turk-driven Casting Words, though you potentially sacrifice some quality. In my experience, though, there were virtually no errors.
 
We used to use CastingWords for our sites (including Gamasutra.com) when they first started out. At that time, the service was pretty much straight using Mechanical Turk with not much in the way of post-editing.
 
One great thing about MTurk is that people on it are used to HORRIBLY rote tasks, like identifying road markings (!), so anything like transcription of an interesting interview is actually exciting for them.
 
I just tested two approaches using the new batch HIT builder interface for receiving file uploads, and neither worked. You can receive file uploads individually using the previous version of the Requester Site, but you sacrifice all the power of the HIT builder templating. Oh, well.
 
@Tod: What an inane comment. Firstly, allotting someone two hours to transcribe a five minute MP3 is ample time. Many people could do it in fifteen or twenty minutes. In addition, as Andy writes, many of the people who use Turk are from the US.
 
Glad to see people using the new interface of Mechanical Turk. With the programming barrier down, it is just a matter of time to see clever tasks uploaded on MTurk that will really use the power of the tool.
 
To those complaining about minimum wage: Mechanical Turk is not a place to distribute professional assignments. (Sites like Guru.com and Rentacoder.com perform this task quite well.) It is more like freelancing because people can work whenever they want, for however long they want. A normal employee does not get this.
 
I have done some volunteer work in Cambodia (i.e. sweatshops) the people working there consider themselves very lucky (as opposed to toiling in fields during droughts) and often support their family on their wages.
 
I started out as a turker but have turned into a requester (someone who pays for mturk work). The quality of responses varies widely, especially when workers have to write in freeform English. I need people who can competently write in modern English, so I did a little test. I uploaded the four Gospels from the King James Bible and asked the workers to rewrite individual verses in their own words. Click on my name to see the final results.
 
If you are going to do a lot of the same task repeatedly over time, it is best to qualify workers and only accept the ones who do quality work. It is easy to create qualifications through the command line interface.
 
Though you have found a great price for transcription, I would be amazed if the quality was good. With regards to audio transcription, you will get what you pay for. Of course there are times when you have very clear audio and may be able to get a good quality transcript in return, but why chance that? There are so many good quality transcription providers out there that still offer competitive pricing.
 
I am not objecting to it at all. All I was saying is that, almost always, you will get what you pay for. I have witnessed many situations where clients ended up having to pay twice because of the poor quality they received the first time. However, I am all about saving when and where you can. Of course, I would love for everybody to come to my website for their transcription needs, but if they are happy somewhere else, then that is also wonderful. I am sorry if I came across in a bad way with my post. Have a great day.
 
Lastly, how will I know when my HIT has been completed or I have some results to view? Will I be emailed? Will I have to blindly keep checking the site myself on a regular basis? I have no idea, and again this is not spelled out anywhere. There are almost no account settings for requesters to configure, and the documentation is laughably sparse.
 
I like this idea that Andy has initiated using Mturk for transcribing. I would like to complete a general transcription (one speaker very clear completed using express dictation) and see how Mturk does. Please inform me how I add the mp3 file on the Mturk request page. My initial mp3 will be 47 seconds duration.
 
I started my task in the middle of the night, it was done in three hours without waiting for a quote or approval, and my 36-minute recording was transcribed while I slept, in less than three hours, for about $0.40 per minute of audio.
 
Were the results as clean as what your company could provide, given enough time and money? Absolutely not. It had some errors, and was returned in several rows of a spreadsheet instead of a single Word doc. But the quality was definitely good enough for me and saved me hours of work.
 
I transcribe for Casting Words and have done other transcriptions on M-Turk. CW is definitely worth the time and I make more than minimum wage assuming there is good work up and admittedly sometimes there is not.
 
If people are getting back transcripts with many errors, they probably are sending in poor quality audio. Believe me we get a lot of that! I do a lot of editing and I can guarantee that what I send out of clear, normal American speach will be 99% correct.
 
The system we use now has multiple stages. We split up the files into smaller chunks which are then picked up by our transcribers. Each transcript is then reviewed, speaker initials and timestamps are added and then they are finally collated.
 
I am in the midst of writing a book and I have recorded my thoughts as a way of getting things down as a foundation for expanding. Some times things are a little broken, where I change thoughts mid stream so to speak. What things should I bear in mind while seeking a transcription?
 
A modified or clean verbatim will remove only the previously mentioned words, but if you start an idea and trail off after several words, that will be included in the transcript. You would be responsible for editing any of those types of things out yourself, or leaving them in if they helped make a point.
 
Again, the amount of editing you trust the transcriptionist to do is up to you. I think you are safest going with a modifi
