I clearly understand that the guide says the Hypervisor Supported are VMware ESXI. But I want to use it in my VMware workstation. 
I have downloaded ovf template and installed it on the Workstation. the installation was completed quickly but in the CLI login, I'm getting stucked.
 
So my question is , If i can work on VMware workstation? or are there any workaround to get it resorted ? In vmware workstation, I have built PA labs using VM series Images before . I don't know if this trial image has any particular restrictions!

Might need to boot into maintenance mode and factory reset the configuration prior to it coming up fully. The trial specifically seems to be having an issue actually booting without that step. Workstation will support the VM just fine, even if it's not officially supported.
 
You're right to act as soon as it starts, but don't just hit a key. You have to mouse click to enter the VM, and then hit the key (F2 for BIOS or ESC for boot menu) F12 for network boot though I haven't used network boot.
 
When the virtual machine starts, the mouse cursor changes from an arrow to a hand cursor, but you are not in the virtual machine unless you click, and then the cursor will disappear. Then, it will respond to key presses.
 
You can also edit the vmx file of the virtual machine, and add the line bios.bootDelay = "15000" (15000 milliseconds is 15 seconds but you can change it to whatever) and you get another screen that offers the same keys and a 15 second delay to hit them. Of course, you have to click first. You might want to shorten it from 15 seconds. But if you've been missing it you might appreciate the screen being there for 15 seconds, then change it once you've figured out how to do it.
 
Another option is "power on to firmware", try it, it goes to the BIOS. It's in the menu when right clicking a VM, or in the VM menu at the top. And in some versions of vmware workstation it's "power on to BIOS". In my version it's "power on to firmware" but it goes to the BIOS
 
This adds a delay to the initial POST screen, showing it for longer and giving you more time to access the BIOS setup, where xxxx is the number of milliseconds to show the POST screen. (There are 1000 milliseconds in a second.) The maximum value for the boot delay is 10000 milliseconds or 10 seconds.
 
It is not support by Aruba officially but you can install it on vmware workstation. After installation, before powering up the VM, edit the VM and just add another hard drive with 80Gb or more capacity. You are good to go!

I imported the vmdk file to Workstation and then mounted the ISO to the machine. However, it keeps asking me the installation file. Can you ellaborate a little on what you mean by Importing the VM. I don't believe there's an option for that in Workstation. Not that proficient in it though.
 
Multiple versions of the same packages.
Out of date packages.
Broken or only partially working packages.
Improperly configured packages which download unnecessary dependencies, or do not download necessary dependencies, or both.
**Malicious packages (although extremely rare).**
 
If you do do it manually try you will most likely run into library incompatibilities and you will need to compile the kernel modules by hand and this you will have to do it on every subsequent kernel update.
 
Due to my job and the professional aspect I have used licensed versions but I stopped at v12.5 - and I have not yet met any member on this forum who can clearly explain to me the benefits of VMware over VirtualBox.
 
here Best way to install vmware workstation - #12 by linux-aarhus
you told me to run sudo pacman -Syu linux511-headers without the dkms
should i do it now?
looking in pamac,i see i have dkms 2.8.4-1 installed;is it the same?
 
trying to deploy for testing purpose, F5 Version: 16.1.4.1 Build 0.0.5 on vmware workstation pro and connecting network cards as in host only mode, these don't seem to work, although the first card I connected for management responds to me and allows me to arrive on the apparatus.
for example the same configuration on other appliances such as fortigate works for me and I can see and use all the cards.
 
Good Day! I am currently deploying Fortigate VM64 in VMWare workstation. I have configured my LAN properly using LAN Segment and bridge mode with only one subnet 10.10.0.X. I want to establish multiple zones in my virtual workstation, so I tried to change the subnet and created the policy for zone 1,2 and 3 going to WAN in the Fortigate but still i don't have an internet connection in my virtual host. Would it be needed to add a NIC card to the virtual host as host-only and bridge it to the created LAN Segment to the zone? or it is only necessary to bridge the WAN port (Port 2) of Fortigate VM with the Remote NDIS where my smartphone is providing a USB Tether Connection in order to have an internet. Hoping for your response. Thanks!
