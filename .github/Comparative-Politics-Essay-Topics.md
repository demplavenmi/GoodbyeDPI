For example, for some essay writing assignments, your instructor may ask you to create a comparative essay that compares and contrasts two things. This type of essay is common in high school and college English classes, as well as in other disciplines such as history or sociology.
 
Unlike other essay writing styles, comparative essays present a unique challenge for students in that they require the use of both critical thinking and analytical skills. To write a successful comparative essay, you will need to understand how to compare and contrast two different subjects effectively.

Before you start writing your comparative essay, it is important to understand the basics of this type of essay. A comparative essay is an essay that compares two or more subjects. These subjects can be anything from people, places, things, concepts, or events.
 
The key to writing a successful comparative essay is to find two subjects that are similar enough to be compared but different enough to provide an interesting and insightful contrast. For example, you could compare and contrast two different historical figures, two different novels, or even two different theories.
 
Once you have selected your subjects, the next step is to determine what points of similarity and difference exist between them. This will require you to research both subjects to identify their key features.
 
This thesis statement example clearly identifies the two subjects being compared (presidents Kennedy and Lincoln), the points of similarity and difference (their approaches to politics), and what will be proven in the essay (that their differences led to different outcomes).
 
The body paragraphs of your essay will each focus on one point of comparison. So, for example, if you are comparing and contrasting two different presidents, you may want to focus on their policies on civil rights in one body paragraph and their foreign policy views in another.
 
It is important to make sure that your evidence is both relevant and persuasive in order to support your argument. In addition, be sure to provide counterarguments to any opposing viewpoints you anticipate your reader may have.
 
In addition, the conclusion should leave your reader with a strong impression of what they have just read. You may want to end with a thought-provoking question or an interesting quotation that will stay with your reader long after they have finished reading your essay.

Political science addresses how individuals and groups organize, allocate, and challenge the power to make collective decisions involving public issues. The goal of the major is to enable students to think critically and analytically about the agents, incentives, and institutions that shape political phenomena within human society. The subfields of political philosophy and analytical political theory (which includes the study of both qualitative and quantitative methodology) support the acquisition of the lenses through which such thought skills can be enriched. The subfields of American government, comparative politics, and international relations, in turn, allow students to reinforce and refine those skills, while also promoting their application to a wide variety of contexts, whether contemporary or historical. Students may also construct interdisciplinary curricula, which allows them to apply the approaches of the discipline to a topic for which a more complete understanding also involves approaches gleaned from other disciplines.
 
**Students are held to** **the requirements that were in place when they declared their major**. However, with approval from the director of undergraduate studies (DUS), the following requirements, updated for the academic year 2022-2023, may be fulfilled by students who declared the major in a prior term.
 
**All students, regardless of their graduating year,**may also take courses related to political science that are offered by other departments. Students who elect the standard program may petition to count up to two such courses toward the major. Students may routinely count Residential College Seminars taught by members of the Political Science faculty toward the major, and they may petition to count one Residential College Seminar taught by an instructor outside the department. Students who have completed Directed Studies may, with the approval of the DUS, count one term of DRST 005 or DRST 006 toward the major.
 
Students wishing to pursue the Political Science major with an interdisciplinary concentration must submit an application, which is due prior to the beginning of the November recess in the student's final year of enrollment. Students should also meet with the DUS to discuss their proposed program of study in their sophomore or junior year.
 
Juniors wishing to pursue an intensive major must apply to the DUS. The application should contain: (1) the intensive major application form signed by a faculty adviser who has agreed to supervise the student for the final three terms of enrollment; (2) a plan of study that identifies the political science courses that will be taken in those three terms; and (3) a one-page description of the proposed senior essay.
 
Seniors in the major must complete a senior essay. The essay can be written either in one term or over both terms of the senior year. In order to graduate from Yale College, a student majoring in Political Science must achieve a passing grade on the senior essay. The senior requirement for the standard B.A. degree program with an interdisciplinary concentration is the same as for the standard program, with the provision that the essay must be written on a subject that falls within the field of concentration.
 
One-term essays may be written either in a seminar or, with the approval of an adviser and the DUS, in PLSC 480. More extensive information about the senior essay can be found on the department website.
 
Majors who wish to enroll in the yearlong senior essay must apply for admission in their junior year. By the appropriate date, students should submit to the office of the DUS: (1) the yearlong senior essay prospectus form signed by a faculty adviser who has agreed to supervise the student during both terms of the senior year; and (2) a one-page statement describing the research project. Due to space constraints in PLSC 490, it is expected that no more than fifteen students will be admitted each term.
 
**Students graduating in spring 2026 and subsequent classes**have the option of choosing an honors track or a non-honors track. Senior essays of students seeking to fulfill the honors requirements may be either semester-long or year-long. Honors will be awarded to students who meet the standard for honors on their senior essay (as determined by a second reader appointed by the director of undergraduate studies) and who meet certain standards of achievement across graded coursework in the major as determined by the chair, the DUS, and the faculty. Senior essays of students not seeking to fulfill the honors requirements must be written within a seminar and will not be assigned to a second reader.
 
The DUS and other members of the department can provide advice about departmental requirements, options within the major, requirements of two majors, study abroad, and other matters related to the major. Majors must secure written approval of their course selections each term from the DUS. All subsequent changes in a student's major program must also be approved. Although advisers (beyond the DUS and the senior essay adviser) are not formally assigned, students are encouraged to seek advice from other department faculty members who are knowledgeable about their fields of interest. Information on faculty interests can be found on the department website.
 
Students who study in a junior term abroad program or at another university during the summer may, with the approval of the DUS, count up to two courses toward the major. Students who study in a junior year abroad program may, with the approval of the DUS, count up to four courses toward the major. Students may also petition to have non-Yale courses that were not taught in political science departments count toward the major. Pending approval of the DUS, these courses will count toward the maximum number of substitutions.
 
The programs in Global Affairs and in Ethics, Politics, and Economics have substantial overlap with Political Science. Many courses offered by these programs may count toward requirements of more than one of the three majors.
 
First-year students considering Political Science as a major may find it useful to take some introductory courses in the field. These courses provide a good orientation to issues explored at a deeper level in more advanced offerings, such as departmental seminars reserved mostly for majors.

In addition to these requirements, the ICP program also requires a Statement of Purpose **and** a 500-word essay discussing a topic in international relations or comparative politics that interests you. After your application is submitted, you will also be asked to set up an admissions interview to complete the process.
 
This writing sample is one of the most important aspects of your application materials and provides the admissions committee a good sense of both your interests and your abilities. You should treat this essay as a piece of academic writing and use some of the best sources available on your
