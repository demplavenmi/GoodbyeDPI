The multi function edit selection tool is designed for fast sound editing with a mouse and keyboard. It even works during live playback and recording so you can fix problems as you hear them! The edit selection tool automatically changes based on where you click so you can work faster. It combines arrow and marquee tools and gives you a new way of selecting edits. You can click the lower half of a clip to select or move it, the upper half to set an edit point, or drag a range to select it. There are dozens of new sound editing commands that you can customize with your own keyboard shortcuts. The playhead snaps to the selection, so you can start playback without manually moving the playhead!
 
The Fairlight audio timeline combines clip and waveform editing in a single view, so you don't have to switch to a different window for sound editing. Like the edit page, you can use the selection arrow to rearrange clips, extend or shorten them, quickly add fades and adjust levels. For waveform editing, just zoom all the the way in to see the individual audio samples! The closer in you zoom, the easier it is for you to spot clicks, pops or other problems. Once you have zoomed all the way in, the pointer becomes a pencil tool allowing you to redraw the waveform or draw a new one, and remove unwanted sounds! Changes to the waveform automatically update in real time when you zoom out.

Every track includes real time equalization and dynamics processing to sweeten and fine tune your mix. This is in addition to your six real time track effects, making Fairlight far more powerful than other digital audio workstation software! Simply double click in the EQ area above any channel strip in the mixer to open the 6 band parametric equalizer. There are graphic controls and knobs for equalizing and filtering different tonal ranges. Double clicking the dynamics area will open the dynamics window which features expander, gate, compressor and limiter dynamics processing. Use the interactive controls to sweeten your tracks, save presets and even copy settings from one track to another.
 
FlexBus is an incredibly flexible audio busing and routing system. Instead of fixed aux, sub and main buses, FlexBus gives you multi purpose, up to 36 channels wide, buses that allow every track to send post fader information to as many as 20 sets of buses, with each set containing up to 3 busses, for a total of 60 destinations. In addition to tracks, buses themselves can be sent to 20 additional sets of buses.You can manage high track counts and extensive plug-in processing on all of your channels and buses. FlexBus allows you to create massive projects with support for cascade style busing, extensive plug-in processing, perfect synchronization and multiple deliveries from a single project.
 
DaVinci Resolve includes over 25 Fairlight FX plug-ins for audio repair, creative sound design and mixing. You can also add third party Steinberg VST and Mac audio unit plug-ins. When you drag and drop one to a clip or track, its custom interface window will open so you can adjust its settings. Multiple plug-ins can be added to a clip, you can copy and paste effects between clips or tracks, and even save an entire effects chain in the presets library for use in other projects. Plug-ins are processed in order from top to bottom. You can delete, open and reorder them in the inspector. If processor heavy plug-ins affect playback, simply right click and select from the cache or bounce options.
 
The Fairlight audio page offers a variety of bounce options for quickly rendering audio as you work. This lets you improve playback performance by "bouncing" processor intensive clips and tracks, consolidating tracks, or generating finished audio files. Simply right click on a clip and select either bounce audio effects or bounce clips to files. "Bounce clips to files" opens a dialog where you can enter a clip name, tags, change the clip format, and choose a destination for the rendered file. You can also bounce selected tracks to a new layer or bounce a mix to a track. Bouncing a mix will always result in a channel configuration that matches the source bus.

Now you have a variety of intuitive mixing options for quickly controlling clip, track and bus levels. For quick gain changes across multiple clips, drag an edit selection range and use keyboard shortcuts to raise or lower levels. Monitor your mix parameters with independent controls to enable and show the automation toolbar. Manage plugins and processing in the mixer with right click menu options to delete, disable or replace plugins, copy and paste processing, or drag and drop effects to reorder, copy or move to other channels. You can even convert fixed bus projects to FlexBus in one click. Fairlight lets you refine the sound of your mix with precision accuracy from start to finish!
 
Fairlight gives you the flexibility to change clip and track channel mapping at anytime. This is incredibly important when dealing with multiple microphone sources, to eliminate an unwanted channel, or to isolate dialogue from a 5.1 or 7.1 multichannel clip. In addition, you can also use "adaptive" tracks for non standard formats with support for up to 24 channels per clip or track. No matter how many sources you sync to your clips, they will playback seamlessly and can be edited to a single multi channel track or separate mono tracks. Track format can be changed by right clicking on the track header. Clip format can be changed by right clicking on the clip and changing clip attributes.
