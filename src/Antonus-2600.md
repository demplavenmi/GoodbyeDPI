Handmade like the original, the sensation and feeling is a true experience if you know how the classic unit is. Also this Original Size version includes exclusive knobs, shaped from the original ARP 2600 knobs but with special window that allow the pass of light. The user can adjust the light level for use like the classic non illuminated ARP2600 or enjoy with the illuminated slider light of the Antonus version.
 
Today using this classic technology and working techniques implies lot of work and effort compared with the current modern mass production process like SMT devices. We are far from this manufacture process with this instrument, because for this special work this deserves this kind of special dedication, love and of course taking the care for the sound and behaviour of some special components that brings us the famous personality of the classic 2600.
 
This interface is an small daughter board for the instrument and is the only digital part and the only SMT board used, due to the nature of the components of the digital to analog conversion that any MIDI to CV interface implies.

Also we added something demanded for our previous customers, the balanced output interface. Located at the right side and using the XLR/Jack dual connector you can use this lines for connect to the mixers and audio interfaces using balanced lines and also keeps the traditional front panel mini jacks outputs like the original ARP2600. With this you can connect the main outputs using mini jack 3,5mm (non balanced) , Jack 6,3mm (balanced) and XLR connectors (balanced)
 
Choose between the two cabinets options, for the classic and stylish Tolex Roadcase like the original ARP 2600 or the sturdy, beautiful and more affordable metal case in textured black paint. Take a look the two different finish options to choose the best finish for your 2600.

The sliders design has been changed to a LED-lit design that allows a very visual and direct experience Also since 2021 the new transluced slider knobs, to add better touch feeling and keeping the illuminated colour looking.
 
With the Antonus Step Brother we add a very inspiring analog sequencer based on the classic ARP Sequencer and also adding lot of exciting new features for expand the 2600 design. Extra VCO, ADSR, 2x VCA and frequency / clock divider are some of the new features.
Also with the Antonus Sidecar we bring the connection with the eurorack modular modular world, in a total integration with the 2600 and Step Brother, creating the ANTONUS SYSTEM, an infinite world of possibilities for sound creation.
We want this reinterpretation of the classic to achieve an integration with current studio and live configurations reliably and without giving up the character and feeling of such a special design as the ARP 2600 was.
 
Since long time many users were asking for it, and now the moment arrived. Here is an original scale replica of the ARP 2600, grey face and ARP orange version, with the classic sound and behaviour using the same technology and components. Also incorporating two hi grade balanced outputs in dual XLR and Jack sockets.

A unique sequencer design, the perfect mate of our modular system. Based on the design of the ARP Sequencer 1601 but expanded. We have added a Clock Divider, an ADSR, a VCO / LFO and 2 VCAs, and of course, MIDI connection. A sequencer system fully oriented for live performance and for immediate improvisation. Of course made with the classic 2600 design rules.
 
Expand your system with your favorite Eurorack modules. Maintaining the aesthetics and work philosophy of your Antonus system. Power supply and high quality distribution bus thinking in great stability and security for your eurorack modules. Has buil in USB power output to connect your devices efficiently
 
Continuing the design legacy, we made the Eurorack expansion for the mythical and classic ARP 2600.
148HP of Eurorack modules available to expand the possibilities of this historic synthesizer to the infinity. Includes power supply and distribution system like our Antonus Sidecar. Manufactured with all the care and love in an handcraft way like all our equipment and following the aesthetics and essence of the classic.
 
The ARP 2600 sits somewhere between the simpler pre-configured design of an Odyssey and the flexibility of a full modular. Importantly, although there are numerous patch points, it is possible to use the 2600 as an entirely pre-configured synth. Patching can then be used to subvert standard routings (of which there are many already), access additional onboard functions, or interface with other gear.
 
Where can you buy the Korg ?
My point was directed toward anyone who really wanted a 2600 and was willing to pay that amount, and felt the Behringer version was their only alternative now that the Korg is no longer an option,
 
With the Behringer 2600 and Korg ARP 2600, two new ARP 2600 clones were officially presented this year. One in the cheap range but different designed and one limited and very expensive. Antonus 2600 is also a clone that is relatively unknown. Interesting to know is that the name Antonus is linked to the ARP name. More precisely, the name under which Alan Pearlman previously offered synthesizers was Tonus. Thanks, moogulator for this additional info.
 
The Antonus 2600 is a faithful reproduction of the iconic ARP 2600 with no major new features other than the almost mandatory MIDI connectivity. However, the developers have opted for a more compact format without losing any of the feeling and comfort of the original design. It is not much smaller but a little bit. Also to know is that the Atonus 2600 also comes without a keyboard.
 
The Antonus 2600 Original Size Edition results from countless years of experience repairing the original ARP 2600 and meticulous reproductions of the original circuits and submodules, allowing compatibility between the Antonus 2600 OS and classic ARP 2600. Using through-hole components and designs, each part has been carefully selected to provide the correct sound and behaviour to recreate the classic sound. It also provides an easy way to service or mod the instrument if required.
 
The 2600 OS also includes modern appointments to bring this classic design to the modern age. like the original Antonus 2600 it includes a MIDI and CV/Gate section on the side and two balanced inputs over combi Jack/XLR connections.
