With that in mind, set your students the challenge of summarizing the top three things they learnt that semester in a video to present back to class. Each of your students will have a slightly different take on this which helps accelerate group learning. All of the video files can then be shared with the class for ready made revision material.

For instance, students could track changing temperatures and environmental factors over the course of the holiday period and compare them to the year or decade before. Using graphs and charts in VideoScribe to illustrate their findings. Of course this is just one example, your students can get creative and pick different topics depending on what they're interested in.
 
VideoScribe is so easy to use that even young children can drag and drop images onto the canvas for great effect. This makes it a really accessible activity for children of all ages and abilities. Plus your marking just got a whole lot quicker and more enjoyable!
 
Ask each student to each take a section of your textbook or lesson material and create an animated video summarizing the key points. These can then be compiled into one set of videos to share with the whole class, making revision a lot faster and more fun.
 
Now, they log on to Zoom from their bedrooms, surrounded by unfinished homework assignments and tattered stuffed animals, waiting to be assigned calls, texts and emails by the trained therapists who oversee the program.
 
This document contains holiday assignments for students at Government Science Secondary School in Pyakasa, Abuja. It includes assignments in English, mathematics, and a science project for all students. For English, students are assigned writing prompts involving their future goals, letters to officials about community issues, and analyzing characters from assigned texts. The mathematics assignments cover topics like evaluating expressions, factorizing polynomials, graphing equations, solving systems of equations, and probability. Students must also complete and submit a written report on a science project they will fabricate over the break. Failure to submit assignments on the first day back to school will result in punishment.Read less

For drinks, there are options like **Gourmet Hot Cocoa, Sweet Nutty Stout, Gourmet Hot Cocoa with Peanut Butter Whiskey, and T.G. Lee Eggnog with Peanut Butter Whiskey**. **Nonalcoholic T.G. Lee Eggnog** is an option too!
 
**You can definitely taste the peanut butter** flavor in this drink! **The whiskey hits you right away**, and we could tell that it had a nutty flavor to it. The taste was a little bit strong in our opinion, but it was also very good.
 
The same peanut butter whiskey as the hot cocoa had is in this drink as well, and **we prefer it in the eggnog**. Part of the reason is that **the eggnog is served cold,** which is how we usually prefer our whiskey.

    **4. Instead of assigning homework, suggest they read for fun.**There are great holiday stories and books you can recommend to parents and students. If you approach the activity with a holiday spirit, many students will be engaged. They may want to check out the stories on their own. You can start by reading the first chapter in class and leaving them intrigued. For instance, you can read the first chapter of The Gift of the Magi and suggest students read it over winter break. With younger students, you might promise roles in a play for students who read over break.

    **6. Have students attend a local cultural event.**You can let parents know that instead of assigning homework, you are suggesting students attend a particular event that relates to your classroom. For instance, if you are reading Shakespeare, they might attend a related play or ballet.

    **8. For students who travel during the holidays, homework may impede learning on their trip**. The Holiday time is the one time of year that many families reconnect with distant family members or travel. I remember having to pack hoards of books over some holidays to Spain and it was not fun. I wanted to enjoy the time with family and experience the country fully. Traveling in itself is a learning activity. Let students experience their travels fully.

    **10. Some education experts recommend an end to all homework**. Etta Kralovec and John Buell, authors of The End of Homework: How Homework Disrupts Families, Overburdens Children, and Limits Learning, controversially suggests that homework may be a form of intrusion on family life, and may increase the drop-out rate in high schools. The authors blame homework for increasing the achievement gap due to socio-economic differences in after-school obligations. Consider challenging your own views of the benefits of homework and try to create a level playing field when considering assignments.

    **11. Send a letter to parents explaining why you are not assigning work.** You might want to take the Christmas holiday as a chance to engage parents to play a learning game or do some art with their kids. If families know there is an intentional purpose to not assigning work, they may take the chance to spend more one-on-one time with their child.

    **13. Suggest they visit a museum instead.** With families at home, the holiday time is a great time for students to see an exhibit that interests them or do a fun activity at a nearby museum. Sometimes encouraging these field trips may be more beneficial than assigning homework. You might want to print coupons, a schedule, or a list of upcoming exhibits so that families have the information at their fingertips.

    **14. Encourage students to volunteer during the holiday time.** The holidays are a great time for students to give back. Students might volunteer at a local soup kitchen or pantry. Volunteer organizations are often at their busiest during the holiday time. Plus, students learn a lot from the experience of doing community service. I remember visiting a group home during the holiday time in high school and helping kids wrap Christmas gifts for their families. This is a great alternative to assigning homework, especially for Generation Y who highly values civic involvement.

    **15. Develop a class game.** You might have the class play a learning game the week before vacation and have them take it home to show their family. My fourth grade teacher had hop-scotch math. We often drew with chalk outside to replicate her game at home. Try to think of a holiday-themed game or one that the whole family can get involved in.

    **17. Go on a hike.** Students learn a great deal from nature. Tell students to go outside on a walk and be ready to share their experience when they get back. Did they observe natural phenomena you talked about in science class or different types of rocks you discussed in geology? Or can you tie their walk into a discussion of poetry?

    **18. Tell students to visit an amusement park.**If you are teaching physics or math, amusement parks give ample room to explain the laws of physics and mathematical probability. This outing would allow students to think about the real world implications of science. You may want to even plan a lesson beforehand that ties this idea in. On another level, it allows students to create a lasting memory with their own families.

    **19. Kids need rest!**Everyone needs a mental breather and the holidays are the best time for students to play and take a break from school.****Kids need a full ten hours of sleep and adequate rest. The vacation time is a great time for students to take a mental breather from school. With many family outings and vacations during the holiday time, they will have less time to complete homework. They will come back to school feeling re-energized.

    The holiday season is a wonderful time to celebrate with family and friends, enjoy delicious food, and have fun. However, it can also be a challenging time for students who have assignments to complete before the new term begins.

    Taking breaks to get yourself refreshed is something not a lot of students practice. Taking breaks is what every student should do. Align breaks them with your study sessions. Try to engage yourself in enjoyable activities or hobbies during breaks.

    Strike the right balance between taking enough breaks to refresh and dedicating sufficient time to your studies. Develop strategies to prevent distractions during breaks and smoothly transition back to your study sessions.

    Remember, the key is to find harmony between your academic commitments and your holiday enjoyment. However, if you still think that you can use a helping hand with your holiday assignments, don't worry!
