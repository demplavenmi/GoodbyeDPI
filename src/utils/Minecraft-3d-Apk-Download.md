By default, the coastlines for versions 1.18 and above don't match up perfectly. This is not a bug, but rather because the map shows the underlying biomes instead of the exact terrain. Near coasts, ocean and river biomes often have land, while land biomes can be underwater.
 
For some features like fossils, ruined portals and trail ruins the app currently only points to the center of the chunk they're generated in. Since those structures are small, often buried, and can be offset 10-20 blocks from the chunk center, you might have to do some searching/digging to find them.

The y coordinate isn't shown for every feature. For structures that always generate on the surface or seafloor, this shouldn't be an issue. In other cases, like mineshafts, strongholds and nether fortresses, the structures can easily be found by searching at different heights at the given x/z coordinates.
 
For technical reasons, you need to know the seed of your world to use Seed Map, unless, of course, you want to find a seed for a new world. If you're playing SSP, the app is able to fetch the seed from your savegame. Alternatively, you can use the /seed command ingame. In SMP, you can use the same command if you have sufficient rights. Otherwise, however, you're dependent on the server owner, who started the world and has access to the savegame and config files.
 
This app uses some relatively new web technologies. As a result, some features may be disabled for older browsers. I recommend using the latest version of a major browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari.
 
The first thing you should do is select a seed and version. You can either type it in manually, or you can load it from your savegame. The latter can be done by clicking on "Load from Save..." and selecting your level.dat, or by drag&dropping the level.dat file into your browser window. Level.dat is a small file located in the folder of every Minecraft savegame. You can find the savegames in the saves folder of your Minecraft installation. On Windows you can use %appdata%\.minecraft\saves to get to that folder.
 
Below the seed and version, you can also choose the Minecraft dimension that you want to view (Overworld, Nether or End). This, and the version you use, will affect which features can be enabled. To toggle certain features, click on the icons in the features box just above the map.

Note that some features will only show if you zoomed in enough. This is to keep the app fast and to not flood it with icons. The app will show a warning and all affected features will be highlighted once that happens.
 
The give command is one of the most complicated and powerful commands in Minecraft. This tool is a simple Minecraft give command generator for generating complex commands. Paste this command into chat or a command block and youcan generate the item, but remember you will need to be op (admin).
 
Commands are for vanilla (java or bedrock) edition, but can also work for modded Minecraft. So far it includes, item name and lore, item enchantments and the more advance item attributes which can add buffs or debuffs for users that hold or wear an item.
 
Enchantments: Most enchantments will only work on certain tools, weapons or armour. Be sure to choose the correct enchantments. You can minecraft give sword with enchantments or minecraft give armor generator, choose those items from the minecraft give item list and choose enchantments from the advanced options. There is a huge number ofminecraft give enchanted items combinations.
 
Attributes: These can be applied to any item, when a user holds or wears that item they will receive a buff or debuff. For example, a buff can add or multiply damage that a player does when attacking, where as a debuff could reduce their speed. Try to make a sword that can one hit kill a wither.
 
Can place/destroy: Can place and can destroy are rules used in adventure mode, these allow blocks to only be placed/destroy on the listed blocks or block groups. In this generator you can enter free form text, which gives you a lot of options with nbt tags.
 
Long Commands: The give command can get quite long and break when entered into chat. The is because chat has a limitation of 256 characters (or 100 characters before 1.11). For commands longer than the limit, use a command block and paste the give commandinto the command block, place a button on the side and your command should run when pressed.
 
Versioning: The give command has changed a lot over various versions, most notability the removal of block ids and minor changes to the json encoded dataTag. See notes below, but perhaps one day we can make it work for all versions.
