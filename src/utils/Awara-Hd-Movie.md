Laila says that in northern Nigeria, awara is a staple food eaten by people both at home and from street vendors. Awara is usually made up of pieces of tofu that have been dipped in beaten egg and then fried. Then, the fried tofu is topped with stir-fried vegetables. According to Leila, the most common vegetables served in Awara are cabbage and red onion, but you can cook whatever vegetables you think would go well with this dish.
 
One common mistake that people make when they cook Awara is adding water to the vegetables and overcooking them. Laila remarks that you do not want any soggy or soft vegetables in this dish. Instead, the veggies should be slightly moist from the oil and water that they released, but they should still have a slight crunch to them.

This dish reminds Laila of when she would have a later lunch and not be hungry for dinner. So, instead of eating dinner, she would buy awara with her friends. They would all eat awara while watching television and top the dish with some chili flakes for added spice. In Nigeria, tofu is commonly eaten as a main dish, not as a substitute for meat. Laila mentions that she knows that many Americans only eat tofu as a substitute when they want to be vegan or vegetarian, but she actually only knows a few vegans and vegetarians in Nigeria.

Awara (Astrocaryum vulgare M.) is a palm fruit mainly used in nutrition. We analysed the pulp oil for fatty acid, tocopherol, carotenoid, and phytosterol and we evaluated whether this oil may attenuate inflammation in vivo. In an endotoxic shock model, awara pulp oil treatment decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines. In a pulmonary inflammation model, awara pulp oil treatment reduced eosinophil and lymphocyte numbers recovered into the broncho-alveolar lavages. These results suggest that awara pulp oil administration can efficiently counteract an acute and chronic inflammatory response in vivo that is probably mediated by fatty acids and minor compounds.

The American artist, illustrator and writer Maira Kalman famously said, "Everyone I know is looking for solace, hope, and a tasty snack." Awara, the Nigerian version of tofu or curd cheese made of either soya bean or milk, perhaps qualifies to be all three.
 
It costs Fati approximately N1,600 to make awara from a measure of soya bean. With N8,000, the vendors she supplies to can potentially make a profit of more than N11,000 by retailing the awara she makes for them.
 
The process of making awara is as straightforward as the homegrown goodness of bean that goes into it. The soya is ground after being soaked in water, followed by sieving the chaff. Thereafter, the liquid is mixed with ingredients like potash and alum or sour water and cooked till it boils.
 
In some central and southern states of Nigeria, where the snack assumes the nomenclature wara, the primary ingredient is milk. Local culinary lore in the south-western region has it that wara is named after a town of the same name in Kwara state, where production of curd cheese is believed to have originated.
 
The variant made from cow milk is said to be the preserve of women from pastoral families in the southwest, the majority of them of Fulani. The first step after milking the cattle is to drain the impurities with a sieve. Some Sodom apple-leaf juice is squeezed into the milk as a coagulant before the mix is cooked for a while.
 
Apart from being a popular snack among students of primary schools in northern Nigeria, awara has long been used as a substitute for meat and fish in a variety of home-cooked dishes. In some cases, awara fills the gap in terms of dietary requirements if traditional animal protein like meat and fish are out of reach because of budgetary constraints.
 
Doctors say it aids in digestion and bowel movement, drives the immune system, strengthens blood vessels, reduces cholesterol, improves bone health, and is an easy choice for people with diabetes and lactose intolerance.
