The Broadway smash hit "Hamilton" is a great way to kick off the day with the musical stylings of Lin-Manuel Miranda telling about Alexander Hamilton's (Miranda) fight to come to the Americas from the Caribbean to the building of a nation.
 
And while this is technically not a movie, it is the film of the Broadway play. So if you aren't used to plays it might seem a bit odd at first, but you will be humming the songs all day long after you watch it.
 
The 1996 film was a blockbuster when it premiered in May and continued to gain popularity through the July 4th holiday that year. It even spawned a sequel 20 years later, that didn't quite hit the same note as the original though.
 
The story has a place in the Fourth of July line-up because the story follows Forrest Gump, a man with a lower IQ from Alabama, traverses through life being happy and not letting obstacles or setbacks keep him from doing extraordinary things.
 
The story goes from his childhood hometown life to joining the military and meeting his lifelong friends Lt. Dan and Bubba to even meeting the president multiple times. The movie captured the hearts of millions over the years and even inspired Gary Sinise, who plays Lt. Dan, to start the Lt. Dan Band that helps support wounded soldiers.
 
**Where can I stream it?** You can watch it for free via Pluto. Paramount+ subscribers can also watch the movie. Hulu, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube TV premium subscribers all have it available as well.
 
This might be a bit of a controversial pick. It's not a film about heroics or Americans saving the planet. But the real-world events the movie is based on are integral parts of United States history with the development of nuclear bombs that brought about the end of World War II.

"Oppenheimer" not only looks at the building of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project but also at the aftermath of such a destructive and deadly weapon, Oppenheimer's role post World War II in political arenas and the start of the nuclear arms race with Russia.
 
How strange that with just a couple of notes (given word form in this case) and a majority of people could tell you what film you are talking about. But for those who don't know the famous musical score, we are talking about Jaws.

This 2004 starring Nicholas Cage, brings the treasure hunt to the screen as his character Benjamin Franklin Gates, along with Diane Kruger as Dr. Abigail Chase and Justin Bartha as Riley Poole look to the past clues to figure out where the fabled national treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States and Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War is.

**Independence Day** can be watched online, but the sci-fi movie is not currently available on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime. Released in 1996, the Roland Emmerich film isn't the typical Fourth of July-themed holiday movie. Starring Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman, the title went on to become the highest-grossing movie of 1996. It also caused a resurgence in sci-fi films in the mid to late '90s with its focus on an alien invasion.
 
Independence Day follows the fallout after an alien race attacks countries around the globe, including many U.S. cities. President Thomas J. Whitmore (Pullman) is forced to put together what resources he has left to launch a counterattack. David Levinson (Goldblum), an MIT satellite technician, becomes a key ally as he figures out a way to deactivate the aliens' shields to target the mothership. In order to do so, the team needs help from a skilled pilot, Captain Steven Hiller (Smith). It just so happens that the key counterattack takes place on the Fourth of July.
 
20 years after the release of Independence Day, a sequel was officially released. Emmerich returned to direct Independence Day: Resurgence, which also featured the return of cast members like Goldblum and Pullman. Though it was a box-office bomb, it hasn't tarnished the legacy of the original film. In fact, Independence Day is still viewed as a must-watch each July. Unfortunately, it won't be found included in the most popular streaming services.
 
Independence Day isn't currently included in U.S. subscriptions for Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime. The fact that the big streaming services don't have the rights to one of the biggest movies from the '90s may come as a surprise. The film aired on Starz for a while, and cable networks often air the title around the Fourth of July classic.
 
As of December 2020, Independence Day became available on HBO Max. The title is also accessible to subscribers of HBO as well as a subscription to HBO's premium content through Amazon. There are, however, a few other options for those looking to stream the film. Those in Canada with an interest in Independence Day will find it currently streaming on Disney+ based on 20th Century Fox films now falling under Disney's umbrella.
 
Independence Day is available to rent and purchased on a number of popular platforms and streaming services.
