I am looking for a mac supported software like Quicken home and business that will work on a mac and give me the ability to manage my personal finances & business finances in one system while also letting me write checks in the system and manage rental properties. The quicken home and business would have been perfect but that one is not supported by mac. Any suggestions?
 
Macs don't change to fit a software package, it's the other way around ... developer's are responsible for making their product work with Mac OS. That being said, a visit to the Quicken site indicates it's Mac compatible: -mac. That may or may not include all products.

While I don't know your exact requirements for business functionality, I have been using Quicken Premier to manage a trust and I have not run into any limitations w/r/t income, expenses, check writing, P&L, investments, tax reports, etc. I did create some custom reports mostly for tax reporting, but everyone ends up doing custom reports.
 
Premier doesn't do invoices; and the Home & Business version has rental management features that could be difficult to replicate in the Premier version ... so if you have those requirements then I think Quickbooks is the answer. But for general business management, Premier has been perfectly usable for me.
 
So I'm debating on which software to use for my accounting. It looks like Quicken Home and Business would be perfect except I own a Mac, so I'd need to setup a virtual drive on it to run windows and quicken. The other drawback is that it wouldn't be on the cloud, so I''m also looking at using quickbooks online.
 
Running Quicken H&B on Parallels is one option. If you have a Windows PC, you may run Quicken H&B or QB Desktop 2020 or 2021 with a one time license, then you can access your company file by a remote desktop app on your Mac.
 
According to me, QuickBooks Online is much easier to navigate than Quicken. Tasks are grouped by workflow, so you can easily find the task you need. The QuickBooks Online dashboard has a menu bar on the left that makes it easy to navigate programs. The dashboard shows a summary of total paid and unpaid customer invoices, total spending, profit and loss (P & L), and sales for the selected time period.

Also, QuickBooks Online is easier to set up than Quicken because it's purely web-based, with no downloads or installations required, and users can easily access their QuickBooks Data on their Azure Desktop. QuickBooks Online is also easy to track business income and expenses because its the main focus, but Quicken can be confusing and unnecessary to track business income. There are many other personal financial functions.

I am wondering about the differences between Quickbooks and Quicken home and business software. I am a real estate agent, landlord, and investor and would like to find one product that can help me stay on top of things. It seems that landlords lean towards Quickbooks. But I would really like to keep things under one umbrella.

**Rocket Mortgage, LLC**, formerly **Quicken Loans, LLC**, is an American mortgage lender, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. In January 2018, Rocket Mortgage became the largest overall retail lender in the U.S., and it was also the largest online retail mortgage lender.[7] Rocket Mortgage relies on wholesale funding to make its loans and uses online applications rather than a branch system.[8] Amrock is also part of the Rocket Mortgage Family of Companies.[9] The company closed more than $400 billion of mortgage volume across all 50 states from 2013 through 2017.[10]
 
**Rock Financial** was founded as a mortgage broker in 1985 by Dan Gilbert, Lindsay Gross, and Gary Gilbert.[11][12] The company became a mortgage lender in 1988, and in May 1998, Gilbert took Rock Financial public, launching an IPO underwritten by Bear Stearns.[13]
 
The company started to change course in the late 1990s, shifting from a traditional mortgage provider to an online-focused lender. Traditionally, the home mortgage business in America has been fragmented due to varying regulations in each state and locality. Gilbert challenged this orthodoxy, however, by offering loan applications online that were reviewed by experts versed in the regulations of each region but who were located in a central headquarters.[8]
 
In August 2007, the entire mortgage industry faced a crisis in obtaining new credit from banking institutions and hedge funds. In response, Quicken Loans discontinued second mortgages, home equity lines of credit, Alt-A products, and deferred interest loans.[16]
 
On November 12, 2007, Founder and Chairman, Dan Gilbert announced a development agreement with the city of Detroit to move the company headquarters downtown, consolidating suburban offices.[17] The construction sites reserved for development by the agreement included the location of the former Statler Hotel on Grand Circus Park and the former Hudson's location.[17]
 
In 2009, Quicken was headquartered at One Campus Martius facing Campus Martius Park in Detroit. The company also housed its employees in Downtown Detroit's First National Building, The Qube, Chrysler House, One Woodward Avenue, and 1001 Woodward, all owned by Quicken Loans' parent company, Rock Ventures.[21]
 
In 2014, Quicken Loans grew to be the 2nd largest mortgage lender in the United States, and was the nation's largest online mortgage lender.[22] In 2016, the company employed 24,000 people nationwide, with approximately 17,000 working in the city of Detroit by 2017, making it Detroit's largest employer, minority
