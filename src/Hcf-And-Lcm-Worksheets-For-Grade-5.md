Many students will pass on through school sequentially. They will be assessed along the way, but often they have difficulty in certain areas that often are not addressed. When a problem area appears, students will often shy away from that topic as they matriculate through the system. This often presents students with a problem area that is never truly addressed and cause problems later on down the road. One method we have encouraged our teachers to get in the habit of is assessing students the minute they enter your classroom. An easy way to do this is to give students a complete assessment of their previous grade level. For instance, we would use our fourth grade three form of test with students that are entering the fifth grade. Students may be a bit rusty since they just had summer vacation, but an average student should achieve a seventy-percent score on all three forms of the assessment. This will help you quickly identify where your class as a whole is. You will know right away which students will struggle with the fifth-grade curriculum. You will also be able to recognize your higher achievers. There are some occasions where you may find that your class has weaker math skills. This can happen for many reasons including previous teacher absences, lack of a structured curriculum, or gaps in a full curriculum. In these circumstances we would highly recommend that you spend a few weeks reviewing material that to be mastered in the previous grade level. While some teachers feel that this just wastes time, it does greatly benefit students and will make the new work much more doable. If you proceed without addressing this, you and your students will be in for a tough year. We have several teachers that are regulars here that spend the first two weeks of their school year assessing and addressing. We have a few high school teachers that will not proceed with their curriculum until they are certain their students are ready for it. While it may seem like unnecessary or tedious work, these teachers swear by this method and usually produce the better math students in their respective school buildings.

Grade 2 - Reading really takes leaps and bounds at this level. We go from reading simple sentences to comparing and contrasting two lengthy passages. Students should be working towards reading endurance.
 
Grade 4 - This is the level where readers really start to struggle as we add advanced phonics and have students focus on their reading stamina. Students start to work on grammar skills as well as writing styles.
 
Grade 5 - This is where we start to understand how to validate our answers with quotes and references. There is a good deal of effort set towards understanding what we write and why we write it. Students will start to write and read for purpose.
 
Grade 8 - This level requires deep thinking before writing and reading. Self evaluation and reflection is a critical aspect of this grade level. This is the first time students are asked to this self evaluate themselves.
 
Grade 9-10 - For some reason the curriculum committee lumped the high school grades together in pairs. The secondary level has a wide variation of what works of literature they focus on from State to State and even within regions of individual States themselves.
 
The process of leveling any curriculum usually starts with the help of experts in each of the fields of disciplines. The experts are most likely academics and tied to a major university, but can often be educational consultants that have boundless experience. The experts recommend a general framework of what should be touched on at every progression of school strata (primary, elementary, and secondary).
 
From there curriculum writer's take the framework and build a list of skills and goals students should work to master. They build a scope and sequence chart that aligns all the progressions together. This is usually done at the State or school system level. Individual classroom teachers (depending on the State) or curriculum specialists begin to flesh out from the exact individual goals for students. From here curriculum support companies begin to write instructional materials to help support classroom teachers towards these goals.
