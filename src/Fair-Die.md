Welcome to the U.S. Copyright Office Fair Use Index. This Fair Use Index is a project undertaken by the Office of the Register in support of the 2013 Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement of the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC). Fair use is a longstanding and vital aspect of American copyright law. The goal of the Index is to make the principles and application of fair use more accessible and understandable to the public by presenting a searchable database of court opinions, including by category and type of use (e.g., music, internet/digitization, parody).
 
Although the Fair Use Index should prove helpful in understanding what courts have to date considered to be fair or not fair, it is not a substitute for legal advice. Fair use is a judge-created doctrine dating back to the nineteenth century and codified in the 1976 Copyright Act. Both the fact patterns and the legal application have evolved over time, and you should seek legal assistance as necessary and appropriate.
 
We hope you find the Fair Use Index a helpful resource. If you are concerned as to whether a particular use is fair, however, or believe that someone has made an unauthorized use of a copyrighted work in a manner that is not fair, it is best to consult an attorney.

FAIR Health's mission is to help you understand your healthcare costs and health coverage and to bring transparency to healthcare costs and insurance. We are an independent, national nonprofit organization known for providing fair and neutral information to all those we serve, including consumers like you.
 
We are able to provide reliable information about healthcare costs because each year health insurers around the country send us over 2 billion healthcare claim records, which are added to FAIR Health's database of more than 46 billion claim records. We use information from those claims to estimate what providers charge, and what insurers pay, for providing healthcare to patients all across the country. We make this information available to consumers, researchers, businesses and many others.
 
Our cost estimates are based on claims for medical and dental services paid for by private insurance plans, including the country's largest insurers. Our database includes more than **46 billion private health care claim records** and **45 billion Medicare claim records** for **10,000 services** in all areas of the United States, dating back to **2002**. We receive about **2 billion** new records each year. These claims represent a large portion of the population in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. FAIR Health uses these powerful data to create a reliable picture of healthcare costs around the country, and locally.
 
In addition to creating tools for consumers, we make information available to doctors, hospitals, health plans, employers, researchers, policy makers and others to help them make informed decisions related to healthcare and its costs.
 
A testament to the fairness and reliability of our data, New York, Connecticut and many other states have adopted FAIR Health's cost information as the guidepost in laws protecting consumers, and for many other purposes.
 
We are proud of the recognition that our consumer site has received. Consumer rights groups and the healthcare industry have given a number of awards to our easy-to-use website, mobile app and other resources that help consumers find useful and reliable information. The awards include:
 
We have consulted with leaders in the healthcare field to make sure that our methodologies follow best practices and our data and tools are the best that they can be. Here you can learn more about our data, how we estimate healthcare costs in a geographic area near you and how we decide what to include on our website.
 
We identified providers who performed a common service at least the average number of times compared to other providers in your geozip. From that group, we randomly ordered providers and practices to include on this website. We looked at the claims in our database for those selected providers to identify the range of prices charged for common services, and the most common price that the provider charged for those services, over the course of one year. If there are two equally common prices for a provider, we use the most recent.
 
FAIR Health features provider-specific information for 100 procedures commonly performed in New York State by physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists and other providers. We chose these 100 because they were the procedures most common in the FAIR Health database; the procedures most commonly done in an out-of-network setting; and the procedures that consumers search for the most. We will be adding more procedures in the future.
 
The FH Total Treatment Cost estimates include all the costs for your medical care from the time you get sick or injured until you are better, or when your treatment is over. For chronic conditions, estimates include the typical services for the condition over the course of one year. To create each estimate, we first identify the most commonly performed services associated with each condition or procedure. Then we estimate the cost for each of the services associated with the condition or procedure and multiply that amount by the number of times patients usually receive each service. We combine all the estimated charges for the number and type of services in a typical treatment cost to give you an estimate.
 
In January 2009, the New York State Attorney General announced the settlement of an investigation into perceived conflicts of interest involving the adjudication of claims. The Office of the Attorney General reached settlement agreements with health insurance companies that do business in New York State, and FAIR Health was established as part of this settlement. In October 2009, FAIR Health was formed as an independent organization to bring transparency, integrity, reliability and accessibility to healthcare costs and insurance information for all healthcare stakeholders. Our mandate was to provide an independent database of claims information contributed by payors nationwide, a free website to educate consumers about the cost of care in their geographic areas and insurance reimbursement, and data for research that could help to formulate or evaluate policy and support academic studies.
 
FAIR Health oversees the nation's largest collection of private healthcare claims data, which includes a repository of over 46 billion privately billed medical and dental procedures, and separate data representing the experience of individuals enrolled in Medicare. Certified by CMS as a Qualified Entity, FAIR Health receives all of Medicare Parts A, B and D claims data for use in nationwide transparency efforts.
 
Funded by the New York State Health Foundation, this website houses educational resources and decision aids for various conditions, information regarding costs for medical and specialty care and elective procedures and links to external resources that assist consumers with their health and health insurance. With these resources and cache of information, New York State residents can identify and compare providers and the services they provide in their geographic locations, allowing them to make informed decisions about their healthcare.
 
This website includes those providers (physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors, acupuncturists and others) in New York State who performed one of the 100 common procedures, at least the median number of times compared to other providers in a geozip. We list those providers and practices in random order on this website. Based on the claims in our database, we identify each of those providers' range of prices charged and most common price charged for the 100 common procedures, over the course of one year.
 
We learned from consumers through focus groups and surveys what type of information they would like to know when choosing a healthcare provider. We then looked at the FAIR Health database, which includes provider-level information and pricing, the CMS National Plan & Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) file and the CMS Provider File, and selected information about individual providers that consumers said would be useful to include on this website.
