Hi everyone, I would like to ask if there is any good free app for android to controll a dfrobot with microbit(so no bitty controller).
I am pretty new to this microbit world, by any chance exists a discord server where people are sharing their experience?

@jane , I have DF Robot 2 wheel bots and various android apps for Microbit (example : Yahboom) so I will look into your question. I am on Discord but I have seen no activity there for over a year. I will respond here and you can look at our YouTube Channel: MakeCode and Hardware, there may be a video posted there which answers your question, leave a comment on any vid and I should get a notification.
 
Can anyone help @jane with this? I would like to know also, if this BLE app will work with MakeCode and Microbit and a DF Robot; as seen in the above video. I think it is in Korean , according to Google Translate. When I download a .hex file I am told it will not open due to not being a recognized file: 
thanks

Another person asks this question and I have no answer, do you ? Please and Thankyou:
I am in the process of getting a companies custom board up and running with MakeCode, however I am having trouble with a few things.
 
When creating a custom board and submitting the SVG file into the Board Designer, config.ts is developed for us to edit with pin names and hardware numbers (ex. export const PIN\_RCC1 = **DAL.PA07** ). What are the pin hardware numbers? Is there an easy way of figuring these out for custom boards?
 
very important. I accidentally hit "mute 1 hour" on the android notification and I can't seem to undo it. I desperatly need notifications for that!! Got someone that needs to give me real time updates on a sitiatuon! This should never be there.
 
For a server, when you have selected it and the channels in the server are onscreen, tap the three dots near the top right of the screen, next to the title of the server and then the notifications icon, from there you can change the setting for that server.
 
If I am correct you might have saved your Discord login with the url set to Which does not match the url for the android app, which is com.discord. Bitwarden is asking if you, if you would like to continue auto-filling with the selected credentials although the url does not match. Clicking on the far left option, will autofill and save com.discord as a new url besides the item containing ( ).
