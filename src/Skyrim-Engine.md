**Creation Engine** is a 3D video game engine created by Bethesda Game Studios based on the Gamebryo engine. The Creation Engine has been used to create role-playing video games such as *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, *Fallout 4*, and *Fallout 76.* A new iteration of the engine, Creation Engine 2, was used to create *Starfield.* The Creation Engine has been tailor-made for large-scale open-world RPGs.[1]

Following the completion of *Skyrim*, Bethesda set out to enhance the graphical core of the Creation Engine by first adding a physically based deferred renderer to allow for more dynamic lighting and to paint materials object surfaces with realistic materials. Bethesda worked with technology company Nvidia to implement volumetric lighting through a technique that makes use of hardware tesselation.[2][3] Additionally the updated version of the Creation Engine powering Bethesda's *Fallout 4* offers more advanced character generation.[4][5][6]
 
Bethesda Game Studios Austin (at the time BattleCry Studios) was tasked with modifying the Creation Engine to support multiplayer content in preparation for the development of *Fallout 76* shortly before the release of *Fallout 4*, while Bethesda Game Studios began development of *Starfield* and downloadable content for *Fallout 4*. In conjunction with id Software (a fellow ZeniMax subsidiary), BattleCry attempted to integrate id's *Quake* netcode into *Fallout 4'*s engine. This was considered a challenge by experts in the online game industry. A primary issue facing the developers was that components of the core engine (dating back to Gamebryo used in *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind*) such as quests or world loading were designed centering on a single player (dubbed "Atlas" by the developers for its role in holding up the fabric of the loaded game world), a paradigm that would need to fundamentally change to allow multiple players spanning multiple worlds.[7]

In addition to the network changes to the engine used in *Fallout 4*, the *Fallout 76* implementation of the engine was described at the game's E3 reveal as having "all new rendering, lighting, and landscape technology". Bethesda Game Studios claims the improvements also allow for a 16 increase in detail and the ability to view unique weather systems occurring at a distance.[8]
 
Bethesda revealed in June 2021 that they were working on a new iteration of the engine called Creation Engine 2, and that it would power their upcoming games *Starfield* and *The Elder Scrolls VI*.[9][10][11][12] Creation Engine 2 features real-time global illumination and advanced volumetric lighting.[13] Creation Engine 2 also features improved texture resolution and post-processing effects.[14]
 
The Creation Kit is a modding tool for Creation Engine games. The Creation Kit takes advantage of the Creation Engine's modular nature. It was created by Bethesda Game Studios for the modding community of *The Elder Scrolls* series.[16] The tool can be used to create worlds, races, NPCs, weapons, update textures, and fix bugs. Mods created using this tool are hosted on the Steam Workshop, Nexus Mods, Bethesda.net and various other sites.
 
The Creation Kit is a new version of Bethesda's editor developed for Gamebryo, known as The Elder Scrolls Construction Set for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* and *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*, and as the Garden of Eden Creation Kit for *Fallout 3* (referencing an in-game item of the same name).
 
The Creation Engine is the successor to the Gamebryo game engine, and was launched to support *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*. It retains much of the basic framework and has the same general feel, but adds numerous improvements over the older engine.
 
During the development of *Fallout: New Vegas*, project director Joshua Sawyer at Obsidian Entertainment was aware of Bethesda's experimentation with the Creation Engine, but they did not have the time to work with it for *New Vegas*.[3]
 
*Fallout 4* utilizes an updated version of the Creation Engine, supporting better graphics capabilities and more features. Many of *Skyrim's* features were removed or overhauled to fit the *Fallout* game world and SPECIAL skill system.
 
It had previously been announced that there would be a creation kit released for *Fallout 4* some time in April 2016.[7] However, the *Fallout 4* version builds on the kit released for *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* and drops the G.E.C.K. title in favor of *Skyrim's* designation as simply the Creation Kit. The *Fallout 4* Open Beta of the Creation Kit was released on April 26th, 2016 at Bethesda.net. The kit became supported for Xbox One in May 2016. However, even though PlayStation 4 was supposed to receive the modding tool in June 2016, it was postponed. According to Bethesda, Skyrim Special Edition will receive mods first, followed by PS4 support.
 
The majority of the functionality is unchanged, so modders using the old *Construction Set*s or *G.E.C.K.* will find the *Creation Kit* very familiar. As with every revision to a new game, however, there are a number of substantial changes to various subsystems of the editor to match *Skyrim's* new personality.[8]
 
An updated version of the *Creation Kit* for *Fallout 4* has been publicly released for download for free on the Bethesda.net launcher following the closed beta. It can only be used by owners of the PC version of the game. More information can be found on the Creation Kit wiki.

Game Informer's only gone and posted plenty of info on the new engine powering The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, though the article tells you plenty about the game too, and there's even a screenshot! Look at it up there. So pretty. If I'm honest, that screenshot might be the single most interesting part of this post. Still, let's you and me soldier on for appearance' sake. By the way, did you know the Skyrim's due out for release this Christmas? So soon!

Alright, the info in the Game Informer article can be summarised as follows:
 

On the search for a definitive list of Engine Bugs...
Some mention was made a-whiles back, and having a reference on hand would save time for all submitting and confirming bugs.
 
It would be a substantial list with categories similar to this- containing at least 20 and as many as a hundred. The majority of entries can be extracted from the "Will Not Be Fixed" in Tracdown. I'll have a go unless someone else volunteers.
 
Well here's one: NPC pathing pop-in popout.
 
Suppose a courier wants to deliver a message to the Player, but the participants are separated by a body of water, typically a river. If there is no way for the courier to cross in N cells spanning his trajectory, then he/she will just pop-out of existence at the edge of the cell in the player's frustrum, soon to pop back in some time later. Here's a save that reproduces this.

 
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Error: Happens on some setups with the Dawnguard plugin active. Does not occur once the Arvak or Impatience of a Saint quests have completed so the suspect is in some resource used by those.
 
Actors: Dialogue Flags on a default sleep package appear to affect dialogue when the package is not being run.

"Say Once" flag checked for dialogue may not work when voiced responses are repeated on a game reload. (Related: Repeated Dialog)
 
Object specific: Certain trapped chests play warning sound too early.

Object Specific: Function TetherToHorse() works on a cart once and only once. After loading, or re-attaching a cell during the game, you have to replace the old cart in place, then tether.
 
Animation: In 3rd person view, Player swims at a slight tilt.
 
Animation- Rare: During combat with at least two dragons in the air, at least one dragon will slow down to float, still fighting
 
Animation: NPC specific: NPC walk speed does not match player walk speed. A nice workaround here.
 
Animation- location Specific: Swimming in this location angle your camera upwards, Player begins to plummet as the water vanishes.
 
Animation: NPC motionless when sleeping. Borderline bug technically as the animations were never implemented.
 
Animation: Player blink not present fixed by this.

 
Animation: NPCs in dialog will either not move lips in sync or move them at all. Untested workaround here. This works on the usual suspects Xander Eris and Dorian on the EEC Solitude docks. Another fix using SKSE here.
 
Visual Effect: When saving while casting Clairvoyance, the effect is still seen after the spell expires in subsequent saves. This removes the effect, but also renders the spell useless.
 
Placed References- Flora Harvest Respawn: Travel to a previously "harvested" cell that has undergone the 10 day reset. Save & reload will revert to it's previous harvested state.
 
Perks & Skills: Picking up a dropped stolen item adds another count to the stolen items under crime statistics.

Perks & Skills: Tap "Run" key and hold down "W" to run forever on empty stamina exploit.

Perks & Skills: Tap for silent roll. Other sneak bugs and exploits discussed here.

Perks & Skills: Player advancement by trainer is set, but not displayed until an encounter.

Faction specific: Masked female dark brotherhood initiate shows chin when talking.
 
Shadow striping can be a problem in certain configurations. Fixed by increasing fShadowBias, or with this or that.
