Essential Physics (3rd Edition) is designed for a two-semester, high school introductory physics course. The content is written at an algebra-based introductory physics textbook level, which makes it suitable for use as a non-major college physics book. It can also be used as supplementary material for a Conceptual Physics course as well as AP or Honors Physics.
 
This rigorous yet accessible textbook includes core Physics topics that cover a complete year of instruction forboth High School General and Honors Physics classes. The lessons follow the 5E model and include tools for ELLstudents, as well as tools for students with different learning styles. And the curriculum aligns to NGSS and yourstate standards for both regular and advanced coursework.

The Essential Physics (3rd Edition) e-Book is a fully digital version of the Student Textbook that can be accessed from any web browser.Throughout the text, interactive elements bring concepts to life, engaging students with a combination of embedded videos, animations, and simulations.This innovative text also features:
 
The Essential Physics (3rd Edition) curriculum also includes access to the PASCO Academy, which provides teachers with a wealth of ready-to-use resources for physics instruction. These robust resources include:
 
The Essential Physics Comprehensive Equipment Kit is designed to support 37 hands-on lab investigations within the Essential Physics (3rd Edition) Curriculum.This kit includes enough equipment for a full year of investigations in a standard, algebra-based physics course. When used as part of our Essential Physicsprogram including the e-Book and lab manual, it creates a complete solution for teaching high school Physics. It can also be used to supplement your existing textbook,serving as the lab component of your curriculum.
 
The Essential Physics (3rd Edition) Teacher Lab Manual is a complete set of teacher answer keys for the 46 labs inside the Essential Physics (3rd Edition) Student Lab Manual. Each teacher key provides sample data, graphs, tables, and correct or sample responses for the analysis questions within each of the student lab investigations. It includes:
 
Achieve Labs gives students a place where they prepare, explore and advance their lab knowledge in an online environment. With a variety of pre, in and post lab resources designed to support your lab learning goals, Achieve Labs provides all of the digital support you need for your classroom with a well rounded lab experience.
 
Our open-ended lab simulations provide students with 24 hour access to realistic, interactive virtual labs. Students can make and learn from their mistakes without the worry of wasting materials, time constraints, or lab equipment requirements. Complete with in-lab procedures and data entry as well as improved accessibility features.
 
Our Vitalsource e-lab manual provides students with the background information and procedures they need to understand and complete their lab assignment in an accessible e-book with notebook, highlighting and offline capabilities.
 
This is the laboratory manual for the first course in the General Physics sequence. The course covers classical mechanics and is required of all students in science and engineering programs at Illinois Tech. All of the manuals are in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF). Departmental policy is that these documents can be viewed but not printed in the laboratory rooms, so please print the manual beforehand.
 
These are documents that will help students with their preparation for the Physics 123 laboratory and with the completion of laboratory reports. All of the documents are in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF).
