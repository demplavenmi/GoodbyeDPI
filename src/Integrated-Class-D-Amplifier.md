The integrated class D audio amplifier multi-chip module (MCM) family of devices integrates PWM controller and digital audio power MOSFETs in a single package to offer a highly power efficient, compact solution that reduces component count, eliminates the need for heatsinks, and shrinks PCB size by up to 70 percent.
 
So as we leave October of 2022 behind and enter November the chill in the air is starting to arrive. Living out here in the woods brings the noise of the trees rustling in the wind, the owls projecting their deep and loud hoots in the night and daily visits from the deer who roam the area.

The chill in the air also means it is my favorite time to listen to some good old fashioned CLASS A Amplification! Yes it is true that Class A amps can not only warm the heart and soul, but they can also warm your room up with some heat!
 
Tonight, as I write these words I am sitting in my listening room with what I feel is the some of the most beautiful Class A sound I have heard to date **from an integrated amplifier.** This is in the form of **The Luxman 595 ASE**integrated amp. This is an amp that celebrates the 95th Anniversary of Luxman so it is a big deal for Luxman and Luxman aficionados, though I am sure that whatever they cook up for the 100th anniversary will be amazing as well. Luxman has been around for a long time, and they are known for their audio gear that is always classy, gorgeous and built to a high standard.
 
The 595 ASE is indeed one of those end game pieces and in fact, it will be going into part time duty here in my listening room as it has synergized so well with my speakers (Fleetwood Deville SQ, Dynaudio S40 Bookshelf Speakers, Falcon LS3/5a Gold Badge, and even inexpensive $899 Emotiva towers that punch well above their price point) that I have on hand right now for review.
 
The 595ASE seems to be loosely based around the now legendary Luxman 590 AXII, which has now been sadly discontinued by Luxman (with from what I understand, no replacement for it to come, but who knows). Even though the 595 is based around the lovely 590 AXII, *there have been 120 changes made according to Luxman and I noticed these changes as soon as I plugged this nearly 70lb beast of an amp into my system*.
 
I had no idea it would be as good as it is, as I expected an exact replica of the 590 AXII sound (which is already fanatstic). For starters, this 595 weighs a few lbs more than the 590 AXII and puts out more heat as well in this system so it is a little more toasty (perfect for winter)!

The 595 is limited to 300 pieces for the world. Only 100 were released in the USA and as far as I know, all have been sold or accounted for. I was told by on of my long time dealers where I acquired mine (Dedicated Audio in Scottsdale AZ) that he had brought in the last few from Luxman and the one I was able to acquire was indeed his last 595 ASE. I am not sure if he was able to get any more from Luxman.
 
As for the looks I was not sure when I first saw the 595 in images. I missed the meters initially and thought it was a bad choice by Luxman to remove those iconic gorgeous meters. After much more thought and looking at even more images, I started to really admire the looks and knowing the quality of Luxman gear I figured it would really be gorgeous in the flesh.
 
The Luxman 595 ASE is such a gorgeous piece in the flesh. In fact, it is one of the nicest looking integrated amps I have ever owned or tested. The workmanship is just sublime. Made in Japan, this looks a little bit retro and a whole lotta cool. The quality and attention to fine details is absolutely stunning. The finish of the brushed metal is also luxurious in looks. Each dial and button is solid and appears that they could last for 100 years. I raved about the build of the HiFi Rose RS180 recently but The Luxman is even higher up that ladder.
 
As for the specs, it has the same power output as the 590 AXII which is 30 watts of class A into 8ohms, 60 into 4 ohms. Even so, there is plenty more power on tap as it will go into Class A/B for much more than those 30 watts (though Luxman does not post these specs). I believe the 590 AXII was measured to almost hit 90 WPC after leaving Class A.
 
There is also a loudness button which for some, can be a life saver. If listening at late night at low volume and your speakers sound a bit thin, one click from the unit or the remote will add some bass heft to the music while retaining all of the gorgeous details that this amp provides. I have not needed this loudness control on the 595 but did use it sometimes on the 590 AXII. This will be speaker dependent really. It ups the bass in the mids and slightly elevates the treble as well.
 
When I tested the Loudness button it did indeed fill out the mids but I would use this only at low volume and if your speakers sound thin. That is what it is there for. If used when playing at normal or louder levels it may get bloated or funky with the loudness button engaged. I do not use it at all as the Fleetwood Devilles do very well at low volume level listening.
 
Switch off all speakers and you can use the Headphone output which I tested with so so results. I would not say that the 595 ASE has a top notch headphone output, and it would not be my preference if I had high end cans. It seems to be an afterthought.
 
This 595 ASE can also be used as a pre-amp or power amp! I tested the pre-amp with my Inspire 300B and the results were wonderful. Slightly better than a dedicated pre I was just testing (that cost more than the 595 itself) with the 300B. This surprised me but it should not have as this amp is a statement piece from Luxman that celebrates their 95th anniversary and it seems they really pulled out all of the stops for this one. I feel this is the absolute best they can do for a Class A integrated amp.
 
We get details and micro details with the 595 ASE yet we also have a fully fleshed out mid and bottom end. The Enleum 23-R excels in the top end and dynamics. The Naim SN3 excels with weight and density but not spatial presentations and the Pass Labs INT-250 excels in creating a magical soundstage with a more human touch sound vs the Luxman.
 
The big Pass XP-22 and 60.8 Monos sound the most refined and magical but do lean warm vs The Luxman. Sometimes I prefer that exciting sound and other times I enjoy the big warm hug from the Pass Labs.
 
I have heard this on other amps where the song sounded thin and hard to listen to but not here. I hear every sound, ring, bell, click and clank with clarity and these sounds are placed in the soundstage correctly.
 
Compared to the 590 AXII this 595 is a little bit more energetic, more alive, and even a touch more refined. It seems that almost everyone who has had both say the same thing here. It has more body and drive and this just makes the amp sound so clear, so real and precise. If you own a 590 AXII there is no need to seek out a 595 unless you want that extra bit of performance, or unless you just adore the design. Sound is in the same vein, you just get more of what is good from the 590 AXII it with the 595.
 
I have heard many amps with these speakers and my faves have been the Naim Supernait 3, Enleum Amp 23R and the Pass Labs when it comes to powering them. As good as those are and were, the Luxman powers these speakers in a way I have not yet heard them and I feel that they can not in any way get any better sounding. I have heard these with Class A, B, A/B and D as well as tubes.
 
In my review from 2018 for the 590 AXII I said it could be my last amp ever if I let it be. Well, back then **I did not let it be** as I let it go (sold it) to try the next big thing, as I often do. I am after all an audio addict! In reality, I have missed that 590 AXII ever since I sold it and almost bought it again on two occasions, but told myself no as I sold it when I did have it. I blew it.
 
That 590 AXII integrated gets rave after rave in reviews and is known by many as one of the best integrated amps made when it comes to quality and sound. Of course, if you enjoy the Luxman sound. Some may prefer or ask about Accuphase which has a more plump midrange and softer treble but sounds just as gorgeous. Again, will depend on your speaker choices and tastes in sound.
 
This 595 keeps the same character and it*does run a little warmer than the 590. It gets about as hot as the Pass Labs XA60.8 amps I have here.* With the cold weather coming, this will be fun to listen to. Ill swap out to the Pass Labs on some nights when I want extra warmth (in the music and in the room).
 
The Luxman is more of a rocker than the Pass. The Pass puts out a little more beauty and romance in the sound, the Luxman sounds more powerful and dimensional. There are more details heard with the Luxman as well.
 
BTW for this review I used four DACs. The DCS Lina DAC & Clock, The affordable iFi Neo Stream, a Denafrips Terminator PLUS 12th Anniversary edition and a Weiss 501. All were able to show me the character of the Luxman. I also used a turntable to spin some vinyl, with the internal phono pre and with an external.
 
To date, my fave DAC is still the DCS Lina with the Clock but it does come with a crazy price tag. The price you pay for a name brand, longevity of said brand and the bespoke nature of a Ring DAC. : )
 
The Class A sound of Luxman amps wether it is in an integrated or separates is very refined. It is detailed with a velvet grip and impact. It is dynamic but has that visceral vibe with a juiciness, a clarity, a velvet like transparency that is done just right. Nothing is overdone here and the midrange is clean and rich. Full, warm voices emerge from the speakers, dead center between them in a well setup system.
 
I have heard an Accuphase E-650 integrated. This is a gorgeous int
