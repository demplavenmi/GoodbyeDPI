Welcome to your own treasure trove of Ark: Survival Evolved cheats. Let's not stand on ceremony: You're playing a game where you're some kind of time-clone taming dinosaurs. We're already operating outside the borders of reality. Might as well bust the sandbox wide open eventually, yeah? Ark cheats let you enter all sorts of console commands to enable god mode, level up instantly, teleport, spawn items, instantly tame dinosaurs, unlock all the engrams, and more.
 
Ark cheats are primarily used in singleplayer mode, but you can also use them in multiplayer if you're the server admin or if you've been given access to the server admin password. Otherwise, you can't use cheats while playing online. And if you're looking for other ways to enhance Studio Wildcard's dino survival game, don't forget to check out list of the best Ark mods.

In singleplayer mode, just type the cheats to enable them. In multiplayer, if you have the admin password, you'll need to type 'EnableCheats ' before you can use cheats. Some cheats (while playing on a server) will require the prefix 'admincheat'. In singleplayer, you don't need to worry about a prefix. Just type them and press Enter.
 
First up, player cheats. These are all cheats that are focused on you specifically, whether you're turning on good, old God mode, changing your size, or learning engrams. This is also where we've got your cheats to immediately tame a dinosaur for you.

These commands allow you to give a specific item to yourself or another player. Setting ForceBlueprint to 'true' or '1' will give the blueprint, while setting it to 'false' or '0' will add the item itself.

Admin commands, console commands, or "cheat" commands are typed into entered in a special menu of sorts and can be used in either single-player mode or a private server (dedicated, non-dedicated and also PC-hosted third-party server). These commands will essentially allow you to "cheat." With cheat commands, you can immediately gain experience, make your character larger, increase your weight capacity to infinite, and much more.
 
If this is not your server, in order to enter ANY command, you may need to make sure they have the correct permissions on the server they are currently playing. This can be found either in the server settings or through the use of an admin password.
 
This will adjust the model of your character size and will either make them bigger or smaller. However altering this value can cause issues with clipping, sinking, or mobility problems that resemble rubber banding. If you wish to reset your character size you simply need to enter the value or "1"
 
This command will instantly force tame any dino or creature that is immediately in front of you and within your crosshairs. The benefit of this with this admin command dinos do not need to have a saddle equipped in order to be ridden. But the falloff is that without a saddle you will have a massive reduction in armor.
 
Although a little less is known on this admin command and there have been reports on it being temperamental, but the desired effect is that the two player names included in the command will be forced to join the new tribe as names also in the command.
 
This is used in order trigger or activate a game command, such as run a map or start a new game mode. It would be easier to run this from the back-end admin settings but will still have the same effect
 
Prints all admin entries to console and also to the server log which can be found within the "shootergame.log" file. This can be manually shown again in the admin control page either on console, PC or through the third party provider.
 
Similar to "Get Chat" or "Get All States", this command will send and show all major game log events (restart/stop/start the server) to the ".log" or "servergamelogs" files. This can be printed in PC and can be viewed also in the admin settings control page.
 
Here you simply enter the GFI command followed by the word of the item that you want. This is a less accurate yet faster way to spawn in items or dinos. If a word you think relates to an item does not work, try another version or that word or another word in the title or item/structure/dino. For example, if you wanted a long neck rifle you would input
 
This command allows the user to freely move around the map regardless of collision barriers and physical objects in the world. So you can pass through structures, dinos, buildings and even the terrain. Can be disabled with the use of the walk command.
 
Simply gives experience to the specified player [player steamid], of a decided amount. Only input [fromtribeshare] if you wish to use this command line and also 0 in [sharewithtribe] will share and 1 will not. But it should be noted that this is only effective if giving XP to another player, if you want to use it on yourself or a mount (whilst riding) then use the AddExperience command.
 
This command will add 50 of each resource in the game to the user's inventory. Be mindful that this may easily encumber you if your weight stat is not boosted above 300+ or if you do not have this increased through admin commands
 
This will transfer the targeted dino, item, structure or building to the user who enters this command. However when used on a dino, although the ownership will be transferred it will not be accessible or rideable unless the tame command (forcetame or dotame) is also used.
 
Once entered the player will no longer receive damage from other players, dinos/creatures, explosions, weapons or even fall damage. But it should be noted that they can still receive damage from drowning, hunger, thirst and other natural elements.
 
Will change the targeted player name based on their [player steamid]. A fun command to change the in-game display name of a player but will not affect any other element or property with their game. Purely visual.
 
Will change the targeted tribe name based on their [tribename]. A fun command to change the in-game display name of a tribe but will not affect any other element or property with their game. Purely visual.

Pairing well with God Mode, the Kill All cheat is great for those that simply cannot be bothered defeating mobs, as the cheat will kill any creatures that are within a set distance from your character.
 
**Console commands** are 'cheat' type commands that players with the proper access (generally admins or hosts of local games) can use. These commands including spawning creatures and items, banning or unbanning other players on the server, force taming creatures, set temporary per session rules, gain experience, resources, etc.
 
This will make a back line appear that the player can type in. Hitting the control a second time will make the console screen larger and show the last several commands used. Hitting ESC (PC) or the back button (not sure on console) should make the line or screen disappear. Players can scroll up through the commands and hit enter on a particular one if they wish to use that same line again, rather than retyping it.
 
To use a command on a multiplayer server, the admin or player will need to enable cheats by typing in "enablecheats" (without the quotes) and then the admin password. This is (or should be) different from the server password if the server has one. Official servers will not have cheats enabled. Players on a local game will not need to set a password as cheats are already enabled.
 
After cheats have been enabled on a multiplayer server, most commands used will need a prefix of **cheat** or **admincheat** before the command itself. For example, if a player wanted to force tame a creature, they would used **cheat forcetame** while near and facing th
