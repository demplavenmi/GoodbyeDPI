After arrangements of "Korobeiniki" first appeared in Spectrum Holobyte's Apple IIGS and Mac versions of *Tetris*, the song was re-arranged in 1989 by Hirokazu Tanaka[7] as the "Type A" accompaniment in Nintendo's Game Boy version 1.1. It has since become closely associated with the game in Western popular culture and the Tetris Company has required its inclusion in every version of the game since 2002.[8] In 2008, UGO listed the song as the 3rd best video game music of all time.[9]
 
When I think of Tetris, a few things come to mind. Mental images include playing it as a child on the original Game Boy back in the early 90s, the many ways you can sort each colorful Tetrimino, and of course, the iconic Tetris theme song that I often find myself humming throughout the day, even without realizing it.

Upon reading the poem, one need only to feel its building tempo and signature style to know why it was eventually transformed into a popular toe-tapping Russian folk song. While memorable enough on its own as both a poem and folk tune, Korobeiniki wound up in the backdrop of Tetris.
 
Now that you know where the music came from, be sure to bring up Korobeiniki while conversing with your friends as a way to impress them. After all, who can pass up a fun little round of Tetris trivia?
 
In my opinion, Nintendo's Tetris for the NES had the original Tetris theme, "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy". But, yeah, the one I'm pretty sure you're referring to, "Korobeiniki" (sp?), didn't come until the Game Boy version, by Bullet Proof Software.
 
Funny I have a complete Rom set on my GB Everdrive. I learned a few nights ago the Japanese release of Tetris had a completely different Track A score compared to US/EU release. Track B and Track C were exactly the same though.
 
Famicom hardware also got BPS Tetris, which is a unique title compared to Tengen and Nintendo NES versions. BPS Tetris is my least favorite of the three mainly due to an odd control scheme that I can't get used to.
 
If you wanna play Tetris on a Famicom or Super Famicom, there is none better than Tetris 2 + Bombliss. Tetris 2 plays like standard NES Tetris but with more polish and colorful graphics, instead of our Tetris 2 which was a crappy Dr Mario clone. Bombliss is a super cool Tetris spinoff that uses pieces ranging from singles to pentominoes (5 squares) and contains bombs which you detonate to clear the screen. Join four little bombs in a square to create a large bomb. Unlike Tetris, filling a line does not eliminate it. Filling a line containing bombs in it will initiate a chain reaction. More lines = larger blast radius. There are 100 levels (0-99). You clear a stage by eliminating all pieces onscreen.
 
This means that when Tetris launched worldwide, the game was revised with new Track A music, and this version also replaced the Japanese variant with alternate music. So all but the earliest Japanese Tetris carts have the updated music on them, making the earlier revision potentially rare. Does anyone know of a way to differentiate the two Japanese variants besides playing them?
 
According to its Wikipedia page, "Korobeiniki" was first used as "the Tetris theme" by Spectrum Holobyte in their Apple IIgs and Macintosh versions of Tetris, and was subsequently rearranged and used as the "Type A" theme in the original Game Boy version (perhaps the Game Boy version was developed first with different music but was revised after the theme became popular). The Tetris Company now has a trademark on the use of the song in video games.
 
If you do you own version of any classical folk song or classical song, that version is protected by copyright; that is, the song doesn't belong to you, but the recording of your own play is protected.
 
So indeed, recreating "Korobeiniki" on a Gameboy chiptune style or even for another gameboy game could be seen as copyright infrigtment; unless you prove that there was no other way to reproduce the music on the limited hardware.
 
Regarding the alternate "Type A" music in Gameboy Tetris, I noticed a difference in gameplay: If you start on Level 9, the difficulty ramps up much earlier in the original Japanese release. In the "World Rev. A" release, you need to get like 90 rows or such before it advances to level 10.
 
Hard drop was the intended way to play Tetris, it is how it works both in the PDP-11 version (or prototype if you like) and in the original MS DOS version. The keys in the MS DOS version also are a bit cumbersome before you learn them, but perhaps it is easier to reposition fingers on the keyboard than rethink how to use the gamepad. For that matter, I've also played BPS Tetris on the Famicom and after rethinking my control for a couple of minutes, it is possible to handle reasonably well.
 
I'm not sure about the Spectrum Holobyte versions, but the Mirrorsoft version (e.g. on the C64) also has the hard drop which though is activated by pulling down, and rotate with fire which may be a bit more logic than the other way around as on the Famicom.
 
I read through the threads on Chetiry and found that the BGM uses DSP "buss stuffing" method similar to Pitfall II. The program is updating the sound register on every scanline to produce wave sound, and using the other channel's noise generator for sound effects like dropping blocks, ect...
 
By the way, I started a session of Famicom BPS Tetris at midnight. It only took me about 40 minutes to be confident with the controller, and by the end of my 75 minute session, it was second nature to rotate by pulling down and dropping with the A button. However in the beginning I had to make conscious thoughts how the movement works, which is why I dub the BPS version "Tetris for the Thinking Man".
 
yeah motherfuckers i made a recreation of tetris theme type b its really inaccurate but its as close as im willing to put in effort for WOOOOOyou're gonna need super audio cart and FTPlug for this, you can download FTPlug below plugin great stuffhere is the flp -x6Hm-/view?usp=sharing
 
**The beloved block game Tetris turned 35 years old on June 6 of this year. In honor of the occasion, Story Seeker Joshua Figueroa takes a closer look at where the theme music from the classic game actually came from.**

 
The song Type A, from the 1989 Nintendo Game Boy release of "Tetris," is a major artifact in both game music and cultural history. As the default theme for one of the most prolific video game titles ever released, it lodged itself in the minds of millions and created a musical nostalgia as potent as any Super Mario tune.
 
Based on a Russian poem of the same name by Nikolay Nekrasov, the song is not about falling blocks but a traveling peddler who attempts to woo a woman. How did a 130-year-old Russian folk song make its way into a Japanese gaming machine? The use of Korobeiniki makes more sense when coupled with the fact that Tetris, despite being a landmark release on the Nintendo Game Boy, was never a Japanese game to begin with.

 

It was these versions of Tetris that first included arrangements of Korobeiniki, as well as other Russian pieces like Birch Tree, Dark Eyes, and Polyushka Polye. These clearly Russian-sounding songs were chosen to give the low-fidelity game a more immersive, cultural flavor for its Western release.

Tetris-iolin is a musical machine that plays the tune of the Tetris game theme song. It excites a violin E-string through a servo and there are four solenoids that are used for the dampening mechanism. The string is mounted on a thin piece of laser cut plywood that acts as the bridge. There is industrial grade Velcro alongside the string so the mounting positions of the solenoids can change based on what pitch needs to be produced. Therefore, this machine is fixed to this violin string but is not fixed to a specific song or piece. Using MIDI, any piece can be transposed to an E-string and the positions of the solenoids can easily be altered.
 
The first design of the Tetris-iolin included a sliding mechanism and six solenoids. However, once we decided on the Tetris theme song, we realized that by using an E-string and simplifying the song, we could reduce the number to four solenoids. We also decided not to add a slider as the theme song does not require ant glissandos or octave shifts. In the future, if a harder piece was chosen, the idea of a slider could be reintroduced.
