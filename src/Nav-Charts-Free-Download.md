Charts help you visualize your data in a way that creates maximum impact on your audience. Learn to create a chart and add a trendline. You can start your document from a recommended chart or choose one from our collection of pre-built chart templates.
 
Charts display data in a graphical format that can help you and your audience visualize relationships between data. When you create a chart, you can select from many chart types (for example, a stacked column chart or a 3-D exploded pie chart). After you create a chart, you can customize it by applying chart quick layouts or styles.

You can create a chart in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. However, the chart data is entered and saved in an Excel worksheet. If you insert a chart in Word or PowerPoint, a new sheet is opened in Excel. When you save a Word document or PowerPoint presentation that contains a chart, the chart's underlying Excel data is automatically saved within the Word document or PowerPoint presentation.
 
In Excel, replace the sample data with the data that you want to plot in the chart. If you already have your data in another table, you can copy the data from that table and then paste it over the sample data. See the following table for guidelines for how to arrange the data to fit your chart type.
 
To change the number of rows and columns included in the chart, rest the pointer on the lower-right corner of the selected data, and then drag to select additional data. In the following example, the table is expanded to include additional categories and data series.
 
After you create a chart, you might want to change the way that table rows and columns are plotted in the chart. For example, your first version of a chart might plot the rows of data from the table on the chart's vertical (value) axis, and the columns of data on the horizontal (category) axis. In the following example, the chart emphasizes sales by instrument.
 
Switch Row/Column is available only when the chart's Excel data table is open and only for certain chart types. You can also edit the data by clicking the chart, and then editing the worksheet in Excel.
 
To begin creating a chart in Excel, ensure you have your data ready within the workbook. To create a chart, you can use recommended charts, choose from our collection at Create, or pick the most suitable chart type for your data. Once your data is prepared, follow these steps:
 
100% stacked column A 100% stacked column chart shows values in 2-D columns that are stacked to represent 100%. Use this chart when you have two or more data series and you want to emphasize the contributions to the whole, especially if the total is the same for each category.

Data that is arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a line chart. In a line chart, category data is distributed evenly along the horizontal axis, and all value data is distributed evenly along the vertical axis. Line charts can show continuous data over time on an evenly scaled axis, and are therefore ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals, like months, quarters, or fiscal years.
 
Line and line with markers Shown with or without markers to indicate individual data values, line charts can show trends over time or evenly spaced categories, especially when you have many data points and the order in which they are presented is important. If there are many categories or the values are approximate, use a line chart without markers.
 
Stacked line and stacked line with markers Shown with or without markers to indicate individual data values, stacked line charts can show the trend of the contribution of each value over time or evenly spaced categories.
 
100% stacked line and 100% stacked line with markers Shown with or without markers to indicate individual data values, 100% stacked line charts can show the trend of the percentage each value contributes over time or evenly spaced categories. If there are many categories or the values are approximate, use a 100% stacked line chart without markers.
 
Stacked line charts add the data, which might not be the result you want. It might not be easy to see that the lines are stacked, so consider using a different line chart type or a stacked area chart instead.
 
Data that is arranged in one column or row on a worksheet can be plotted in a pie chart. Pie charts show the size of items in one data series, proportional to the sum of the items. The data points in a pie chart are shown as a percentage of the whole pie.
 
Data that is arranged in columns or rows only on a worksheet can be plotted in a doughnut chart. Like a pie chart, a doughnut chart shows the relationship of parts to a whole, but it can contain more than one data series.
 
Data that is arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in a bar chart. Bar charts illustrate comparisons among individual items. In a bar chart, the categories are typically organized along the vertical axis, and the values along the horizontal axis.
 
Data that is arranged in columns or rows on a worksheet can be plotted in an area chart. Area charts can be used to plot change over time and draw attention to the total value across a trend. By showing the sum of the plotted values, an area chart also shows the relationship of parts to a whole.
 
Area Shown in 2-D format, area charts show the trend of values over time or other category data. As a rule, consider using a line chart instead of a non-stacked area chart, because data from one series can be hidden behind data from another series.
 
Data that is arranged in columns and rows on a worksheet can be plotted in an scatter chart. Place the x values in one row or column, and then enter the corresponding y values in the adjacent rows or columns.
 
A scatter chart has two value axes: a horizontal (x) and a vertical (y) value axis. It combines x and y values into single data points and shows them in irregular intervals, or clusters. Scatter charts are typically used for showing and comparing numeric values, like scientific, statistical, and engineering data.
 
Scatter with smooth lines and markers and scatter with smooth lines This chart shows a smooth curve that connects the data points. Smooth lines can be shown with or without markers. Use a smooth line without markers if there are many data points.
 
Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of filesthat describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might beused to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex,like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.
 
A chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory. Thedirectory name is the name of the chart (without versioning information). Thus,a chart describing WordPress would be stored in a wordpress/ directory.
 
Every chart must have a version number. A version must follow theSemVer2 standard. Unlike Helm Classic, Helm v2and later uses version numbers as release markers. Packages in repositories areidentified by name plus version.
 
**NOTE:** Whereas Helm Classic and Deployment Manager were both very GitHuboriented when it came to charts, Helm v2 and later does not rely upon or requireGitHub or even Git. Consequently, it does not use Git SHAs for versioning atall.
 
The version field inside of the Chart.yaml is used by many of the Helmtools, including the CLI. When generating a package, the helm package commandwill use the version that it finds in the Chart.yaml as a token in the packagename. The system assumes that the version number in the chart package namematches the version number in the Chart.yaml. Failure to meet this assumptionwill cause an error.
 
Note that the appVersion field is not related to the version field. It is away of specifying the version of the application. For example, the drupalchart may have an appVersion: "8.2.1", indicating that the version of Drupalincluded in the chart (by default) is 8.2.1. This field is informational, andhas no impact on chart version calculations. Wrapping the version in quotes is highly recommended. It forces the YAML parser to treat the version number as a string. Leaving it unquoted can lead to parsing issues in some cases. For example, YAML interprets 1.0 as a floating point value, and a git commit SHA like 1234e10 as scientific notation.
 
The optional kubeVersion field can define semver constraints on supportedKubernetes versions. Helm will validate the version constraints when installingthe chart and fail if the cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version.
 
When managing charts in a Chart Repository, it is sometimes necessary todeprecate a chart. The optional deprecated field in Chart.yaml can be usedto mark a chart as deprecated. If the **latest** version of a chart in therepository is marked as deprecated, then the chart as a whole is considered tobe deprecated. The chart name can be later reused by publishing a newer versionthat is not marked as deprecated. The workflow for deprecating charts is:
 
The type field defines the type of chart. There are two types: applicationand library. Application is the default type and it is the standard chartwhich can be operated on fully. Thelibrary chart provides utilities or functions for thechart builder. A library chart differs from an application chart because it isnot installable and usually doesn't contain any resource objects.
 
**Note:** An application chart can be used as a library chart. This is enabledby setting the type to library. The chart will then be rendered as a librarychart where all utilities and functions can be leveraged. All resource objectsof the chart will not be rendered.
 
A LICENSE is a plain text file containing thelicense for the chart. Thechart can contain a license as it may have pro
