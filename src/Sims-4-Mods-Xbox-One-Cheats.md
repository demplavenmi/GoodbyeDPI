Once opened, the cheat console will appear as a thin box at the top of the screen. Into that, you can type any of the cheats below or on other pages. To close the cheat console, simply press the same keys or buttons.

Additionally, some cheats require shift-clicking Sims or objects on the PC or Mac. To execute a shift-click on consoles, hold Circle and press X (on PlayStation 4) or hold B and press A (on Xbox One).
 
While motherlode and rosebud are beloved cheats, an easier way to get your sims the Simoleons they need is by typing "Money X" with X being the amount you want to give your household. You can also use this to subtract funds from your household.
 
The Sims 4 official FAQ says that seasonal events with the NPC Jessica Holiday aren't currently planned for The Sims 4 on console, but items from past events (like Sugar Skulls, Holiday Cracker Plushies, Decorative Eggs, and Magic Beans) are still in the game. You can get them using cheats.

In the Objects by Function menu select the Decorations tab. Go to the Misc decorations, scroll through all the new items, and you'll find Sugar Skulls and the other event collectibles. Buy them, drop them in the world, and have your Sims put the items in their inventory to have them add it to their "Household Collections."
 
While in the cheats console, pressing **SHIFT+]** also increase the size of objects. If you enable additional cheats using the **testinghcheats true** code and then type in **cas.fulleditmode**, you will enable all CAS abilities. Then you can press and hold **SHIFT** while clicking on the objects listed below to produce a menu that lets you select the corresponding effect.
 
The MoveObjects (or Move\_Objects) cheat is a classic from the Sims franchise, and it returns in The Sims 4. To activate it, you must first open the cheat console. Into the box, type the following line including punctuation:
 
MoveObjects used to be used in the Sims franchise to shift household objects when Sims were stuck. The cheat is no longer necessary for this; even without cheats or mods, you can move objects at any time even if a Sim is interacting with them, and the Sim will terminate their actions and reset themselves to a nearby tile.
 
Before I start any of this, I AM ON XBOX ONE, meaning cas.fulleditmode doesn't work. And for what ever reason, editing the household when I manage worlds doesn't work anymore. I can add and delete sims and the regular stuff you can do when changing a sim but I can't age a sim up or down and I can't change the traits. I don't know if this was something that was changed in the infant update or another update, or if it's a bug.
 
@FairClarity Hi! You would need to enter the "testingcheats on" or "testingcheats true" in order to use the "cas.fulleditmode" cheat. On PS4, I was able to enable cheats and enter the fulledit cheat, then enter CAS using the "Likes and Dislikes" section of the simology panel. I was then able to age down my sim from YA to Teen in CAS.
 
Testingcheats was already on because I'm a cheater when it comes to money in Sims lmao. Anyway, this is the first time it's worked for me, it used to not work in any way. I did testingcheats true then cas.fulleditmode and went into change sim. It used to not work, or at least I thought it didn't, probably because you can't do shift+right click on a controller
 
Just to clarify. You do not need testingcheats on to cheat money. kaching gives 5000 and motherlode gives 50000. plus freerealestate on makes all lots cost 0 to purchase. Neither of these will disable achievements as it is the use of testingcheats that turn them off.
 
To activate Sims 4 cheats on PS4 and Xbox One, load into the game and hold down all four triggers at the same time. A thin textbox will appear at the top of the screen. Enter "testingcheats true" in the textbox to enable cheats.
 
If you enable additional cheats using the **testinghcheats true** code and then type in **cas.fulleditmode**, you will enable all CAS abilities. Then you can press and hold **A + B or X + O** while clicking on the objects listed below to produce a menu that lets you select the corresponding effect.
 
If you want to make your Sim a vampire, you can. You can also make them a werewolf or instantly make them happy. And even remove their worries about monthly bills. All you need to do is enter these Sims 4 cheat codes in the game.
 
Before using these cheats, you need to learn how to open the command console. You can only enter the Sims 4 cheats on the command console. You will need to activate it on each platform before using the cheats. Accessing the command console doesn't require you to modify any game files or install mods; it is supported natively, and you just have to turn on some settings. Let us look at how you can bring up the command console on various platforms. You need to enter these button combos:
 
After entering these button combos, a text box will appear on the upper left corner of the screen. Before entering the cheats, you need to turn on the cheats by entering this command: "testingCheats true" and press Done.
 
Anyone know if there is a way to re-enter Create a Sim mode to re-sculpt a sim? I know you can edit topical things like hairstyle, but I mean to go back and fully re-vamp a sim. I'm not happy with how one of mine turned out.
 
In the new patch testingcheats for some reason doesn't work, but I found this (sort of) alternative This doesn't work so nicely for sims you've already happily playing but you can also do the following:
 
1.Ensure family is out of world and go onto the household management tab.2. Click your family and click the "edit" pencil3. On CAS click "new sim" then "play with genetics"4. Change relation to "sibling" then select "randomise twin"This creates an identical, new, fully editable sim, although hair/facial hair, clothes, aspirations and traits would need to be put back in
 
If you go to a dresser ( if you don't have one, you'll have to buy one) click it, and then it should pop up some options.One of them is " Plan outfits" click that one and it should bring you to Create a Sim Again!!
 
I know this works because I edited the Landgraab family. The daddyaged up, I didn't want him to so I used this method to make him anadult again and his wife a young adult since he obviously was wayolder than she.
 
I also did this on one of my sims who was grossly deformed when heturned a teen. His upper body was maxed out to muscles, his legs alsobut his pelvis and buttock area looked like a kid's.So of course Dr vejai2 had to come to the rescue and now he's perfect symetry!
 
While playing **The Sims 4**, you will be able to complete tasks and earn Satisfaction points. As their name suggests, satisfied Sims will get more Satisfaction points. There are multiple ways to obtain these points, both with and without cheats, giving you a few options to choose from.
 
In this guide, we are going to go over every way to earn Satisfaction points in The Sims 4. Additionally, we will take a look at what you can do with these points, as you can use them to buy a variety of rewards. First, let's look at the best way to earn Satisfaction points.
 
**Updated December 22, 2023 by Jacqueline Zalace:**Still looking to rack up your Satisfaction points in The Sims 4? We've updated this guide with a bit more information about rewards store options, including rewards that are DLC-exclusive.
 
The best way to obtain Satisfaction points (without cheats) is by**fulfilling your Sim's aspiration.** This is essentially the main life goal of your Sim; in the image above, you can see that the selected Sim wants to become a musical genius.
 
By **completing the tasks listed,**you will receive Satisfaction points. Each aspiration has**four tiers for you to complete, with every tier rewarding you with Satisfaction points.** Overall, you can earn thousands of points this way.
 
You will be able to change your aspiration, but it's important to note that **the Trait gained from the skill cannot be changed.**The first aspiration you choose essentially sets the groundwork for your personality.
 
Wants will appear based on what is happening around you, but can also be**influenced by personality and aspiration.**In the example above, our Sim wants to be tipped while playing an instrument because she has the musical genius aspiration.
 
A simple way to get more Satisfaction points is by using cheats. If you have never used cheats before,**you will first need to enable them.** This can be done by hitting the following buttons **depending on your platform.**
 
With that, you are set to start using cheats in The Sims 4. The cheat for Satisfaction points requires you to**type in the number of points that you want.** Thankfully, you can type very large numbers, reaching into the thousands. You can find this cheat below.
